## üéØ MARKETING STRATEGY (Initial Thoughts)

### Bootstrap Strategy: "We Published For You"

**Concept**: Pre-populate registry with 100-500 high-quality packages, then notify authors

**Phase 1: Silent Launch (Week 1-2)**
1. Scrape top cursor rules from GitHub
2. Convert to PRMP format with proper attribution
3. Publish to registry under "prmp-curator" account
4. Mark as "unclaimed" in database
5. Build claim verification system

**Phase 2: Author Outreach (Week 3-4)**
1. Email/Twitter DM authors: "We published your rules on PRMP!"
2. Offer easy claiming process (GitHub OAuth)
3. Highlight installation stats
4. Offer to maintain listing or transfer ownership
5. Create urgency: "Claim before someone else does"

**Phase 3: Public Launch (Week 5-6)**
1. Product Hunt launch with 500+ packages
2. Show Case "Most Popular" packages
3. Twitter announcement thread
4. Submit to Hacker News
5. Reddit r/cursor, r/LocalLLaMA, r/ChatGPT
6. Integration partnerships (cursor.directory, etc.)

### Viral Loop Mechanics

**For Package Authors:**
- Badge: "Available on PRMP" for README
- Download stats prominently displayed
- "Verified Author" checkmark after claiming
- Analytics dashboard showing usage
- Revenue opportunity (future): Premium packages

**For Package Users:**
- Discovery: "If you like X, try Y"
- Collections: "Best React Prompts"
- Leaderboards: "Trending This Week"
- Social proof: "10k+ developers use this"
- Easy sharing: `prmp share <package>` generates link

**For Ecosystem:**
- API for integrations
- Cursor could integrate PRMP directly
- Continue, Windsurf, Claude Desktop all compatible
- "Powered by PRMP" attribution
- Community curation (voting, reviews)

### Claiming System Design

**Database Schema Addition:**
```sql
-- Add to packages table
ALTER TABLE packages ADD COLUMN claimed BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE;
ALTER TABLE packages ADD COLUMN original_source TEXT;  -- GitHub URL
ALTER TABLE packages ADD COLUMN original_author TEXT;  -- GitHub username
ALTER TABLE packages ADD COLUMN claim_token TEXT;      -- Unique token
ALTER TABLE packages ADD COLUMN notified_at TIMESTAMP;

-- Claims table
CREATE TABLE package_claims (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  package_id VARCHAR(255) REFERENCES packages(id),
  github_username VARCHAR(100),
  github_id VARCHAR(100),
  claim_token VARCHAR(100),
  status VARCHAR(50), -- pending, approved, rejected
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

**Claiming Flow:**
1. User clicks "Claim this package"
2. Authenticate with GitHub OAuth
3. Verify GitHub username matches package metadata
4. Auto-approve if match, manual review if not
5. Send notification to previous curator
6. Transfer ownership with full history preserved

**Notification Templates:**
```
Subject: Your cursor rules are now on PRMP Registry! üéâ

Hi @username,

We noticed your awesome cursor rules repo: [repo-name]

To make it easier for developers to discover and use, we've published it to the PRMP Registry:
https://registry.promptpm.dev/packages/your-rules

‚úÖ Already installed by 147 developers
‚úÖ Full attribution to your GitHub
‚úÖ Synced with your original source

Want to take ownership? Claim it here: [claim link]

This gives you:
- Update packages directly from CLI
- View download analytics
- Verified author badge
- Control over updates

Or, we're happy to maintain it for you with full credit!

The PRPM Team
```

## üìö RESOURCES & REFERENCES

### Competitor Analysis
- **OpenAI GPT Store**: 3M+ GPTs, engagement-based monetization
- **MCP Registry**: Metadata-only, protocol-specific
- **PromptBase**: Paid marketplace, 80/20 split
- **npm**: Gold standard for package management
- **Homebrew**: Excellent UX for CLI tools

### Tech Stack Decisions
- **Language**: TypeScript (type safety, great DX)
- **Backend**: Fastify (performance)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (full-text search built-in)
- **Cache**: Redis (industry standard)
- **Search**: PostgreSQL ‚Üí OpenSearch migration path
- **IaC**: Pulumi (better than Terraform for TS projects)
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions (native integration)
- **Hosting**: AWS (reliability, OpenSearch native)

### Key Learnings from Market Research
1. No CLI-native prompt package manager exists (huge opportunity)
2. Fragmentation is real pain point (cursor, claude, continue all separate)
3. OpenSearch better than MeiliSearch for AWS deployment
4. PostgreSQL FTS sufficient for <10k packages
5. GitHub OAuth is standard for auth
6. Community curation beats algorithmic only
7. "Powered by" attribution drives adoption
8. Download stats are key social proof

## üìù NOTES FOR KHALIQ

### What I'm Building Now
I'm continuing without questions as requested. Building:
1. CLI registry integration
2. Package publishing backend
3. Bootstrap/scraper system
4. Growth strategy documentation
5. Format conversion system

### If I Get Stuck
I'll document the blocker and move to the next task. All progress will be in Git commits with detailed messages.

### Code Style I'm Following
- TypeScript strict mode
- Functional programming where possible
- Clear error messages for users
- Comprehensive JSDoc comments
- Following existing patterns from current CLI

### Testing Strategy
- Write tests as I go
- Focus on critical paths first
- Integration tests for API endpoints
- E2E tests for CLI commands

## üéØ LONG-TERM VISION (Reminder)

**Mission**: Become the standard package manager for AI prompts, agents, and rules across all IDEs and platforms.

**Success = When developers say:**
> "Just `prmp install react-rules` instead of copying from GitHub"

**Key Differentiators:**
1. CLI-native (developer workflow)
2. Platform-agnostic (works everywhere)
3. Format conversion (no lock-in)
4. Preview mode (test before install)
5. Community-curated (quality over quantity)
6. Open source (trust and transparency)

Let's build! üöÄ
