1. when shownig collections don't prefix with "@collection" because a search that way doesn't
  come up but rather just "startup-mvp" not "@collection/startup-mvp" 


2  also collections for the id are using the name, but really they should have a uuid as the id
  and the name as what is the current id field 

3. WHen installing a package and saying as claude, it still installs it in the .cursor/rules directory

4. WHen saying to download as cursor the file structure isn’t correct with the correct cursor header and isn’t a .mdc file
