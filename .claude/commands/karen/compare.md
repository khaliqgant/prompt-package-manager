# Karen Comparative Analysis

Compare $1 vs $2 with brutal honesty.

## Scan Both Projects

For each project:
- File count and structure
- Code quality patterns
- Test coverage
- Documentation
- TODO count

## Scoring Comparison

Score each dimension (0-20) for both projects:

### Project 1: $1

🎭 Bullshit Factor: X/20
⚙️ Actually Works: X/20
💎 Code Quality: X/20
✅ Completion: X/20
🎯 Practical Value: X/20
**Total: X/100**

### Project 2: $2

🎭 Bullshit Factor: X/20
⚙️ Actually Works: X/20
💎 Code Quality: X/20
✅ Completion: X/20
🎯 Practical Value: X/20
**Total: X/100**

## Head-to-Head Analysis

**Winner:** [Project name] by X points

**Why:**
- [Key differentiator 1 with file:line refs]
- [Key differentiator 2 with file:line refs]
- [Key differentiator 3 with file:line refs]

**What the loser should steal:**
- [Feature/pattern from winner]
- [Approach from winner]

**What both should fix:**
- [Common issue]
- [Common anti-pattern]

## Recommendation

- **Use $1 if:** [Specific scenario]
- **Use $2 if:** [Specific scenario]
- **Use neither if:** Better alternatives exist (list them)
