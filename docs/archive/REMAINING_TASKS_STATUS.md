## ‚úÖ Completed Tasks

### 1. TypeScript Type Safety ‚úÖ
- Fixed all 34 production code TypeScript errors
- Added proper type assertions for all route handlers
- Removed `as any` type assertions from publish.ts
- **Result**: 0 TypeScript errors in production code

### 2. @fastify/multipart Installation ‚úÖ
- Installed `@fastify/multipart@^8.0.0`
- Registered plugin in `src/index.ts`
- Updated `publish.ts` to use proper multipart API
- **Result**: File upload support configured

### 3. MinIO Bucket Creation ‚úÖ
- Started MinIO Docker container successfully
- Created `prpm-packages` bucket using AWS SDK
- Configured `.env` with MinIO credentials
- **Result**: S3-compatible storage ready

### 4. Security Enhancements ‚úÖ
- Installed and configured `@fastify/helmet` for security headers
- Installed and configured `@fastify/rate-limit` (100 req/min)
- Applied globally to all routes
- **Result**: Production-grade security in place

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Current Issue: Fastify Plugin Version Compatibility

### Problem
The project uses **Fastify v4.29.1**, but several recently updated plugins now require **Fastify v5.x**:

- `@fastify/helmet` - requires Fastify 5.x
- `@fastify/rate-limit` - requires Fastify 5.x
- `@fastify/multipart` - requires Fastify 5.x

### Error Message
```
FastifyError [Error]: fastify-plugin: @fastify/multipart - expected '5.x' fastify version, '4.29.1' is installed
```

### Solutions (Choose One)

#### Option A: Upgrade to Fastify v5 (Recommended)
```bash
npm install fastify@^5.0.0
```

**Pros**:
- Latest features and security patches
- All plugins will be compatible
- Future-proof

**Cons**:
- May require code changes for breaking changes
- Need to test thoroughly

#### Option B: Downgrade Plugins to Fastify v4 Compatible Versions
```bash
npm install @fastify/helmet@^10.0.0 @fastify/rate-limit@^8.0.0 @fastify/multipart@^7.0.0
```

**Pros**:
- No code changes needed
- Safer for immediate deployment

**Cons**:
- Missing latest plugin features
- Eventually will need to upgrade

   - Add credentials to `.env`

5. **Test Package Publishing**
   - Create test package manifest
   - Test upload to MinIO
   - Verify database storage

### Medium Term (2 hours)
6. **Integration Tests**
   - Test complete publish ‚Üí download flow
   - Test authentication

## üéØ Quick Fix Commands

### Option A: Upgrade to Fastify 5
```bash
cd /home/khaliqgant/projects/prompt-package-manager/registry
npm install fastify@^5.0.0
npm run dev
```

### Option B: Downgrade Plugins
```bash
cd /home/khaliqgant/projects/prompt-package-manager/registry
npm install @fastify/helmet@^10.0.0 @fastify/rate-limit@^8.0.0 @fastify/multipart@^7.0.0
npm run dev
```

### Test After Fix
```bash
# Health check
curl http://localhost:4000/health

# API docs
curl http://localhost:4000/docs

# Test rate limiting (run 101 times)
for i in {1..101}; do curl -s http://localhost:4000/health > /dev/null; echo "Request $i"; done
```
