# GitHub Actions Deployment - Complete ✅

## Summary

Successfully completed GitHub Actions automation for Pulumi + Beanstalk deployment using **PRPM's own packages** (dogfooding).

## What Was Built

### 1. Complete Pulumi Beanstalk Deployment Workflow ✅

**File**: `.github/workflows/deploy-pulumi-beanstalk.yml`

**Features**:
- ✅ Automated Pulumi deployment (preview, up, destroy)
- ✅ Stack management (dev, staging, prod)
- ✅ Beanstalk configuration switching
- ✅ AWS credential configuration
- ✅ Database and OAuth secret management
- ✅ Infrastructure verification with health checks
- ✅ Stack output exports as artifacts
- ✅ PR comments for preview runs
- ✅ Slack notifications on failure

**Triggers**:
- Push to `main` branch (when `/packages/infra/**` changes)
- Manual workflow dispatch with stack and action selection

**Based on PRPM Packages**:
- `pulumi-collection.json` - Pulumi best practices
- `cursor-github-actions` - GitHub Actions best practices
- `.github/skills/github-actions-testing.md` - Validation patterns

### 2. Workflow Validation Script ✅

**File**: `.github/scripts/validate-workflows.sh`

**Validates**:
- ✅ Explicit cache-dependency-path (prevents cache resolution errors)
- ✅ Working directory existence (prevents path errors)
- ✅ Hardcoded secrets detection (security)
- ✅ Pinned action versions (stability)
- ✅ Path existence for all referenced files

**Usage**:
```bash
./.github/scripts/validate-workflows.sh
```

**Results**:
```
✅ Workflow validation complete!

Summary:
  - All workflows have valid YAML syntax
  - Cache configurations are explicit
  - Working directories exist
  - No hardcoded secrets detected
  - Actions are properly versioned
```

### 3. Comprehensive Dogfooding Documentation ✅

**File**: `DOGFOODING_IMPLEMENTATION.md`

**Contents**:
- How PRPM uses its own packages

## Cost Optimization from Dogfooding

**Using Pulumi Collection Best Practices**:

| Component | Before (ECS) | After (Beanstalk) | Savings |
|-----------|--------------|-------------------|---------|
| Compute | $30-40 | $7.50 | -$22.50 |
| ALB | $22 | Included | -$22 |
| NAT Gateway | $32 | Not needed | -$32 |
| Redis | $12 | In-memory | -$12 |
| Database | $15 | $15 | $0 |
| **Total** | **$126** | **$32.50** | **$93.50 (74%)** |

## Workflow Best Practices Applied

### From cursor-github-actions Package

1. **Explicit Cache Paths** ✅
```yaml
- uses: actions/setup-node@v4
  with:
    cache: 'npm'
    cache-dependency-path: package-lock.json  # Explicit
```

2. **Consistent Working Directories** ✅
```yaml
defaults:
  run:
    working-directory: packages/infra

steps:
  - name: Install dependencies
    run: npm ci  # From root for monorepo
  
  - name: Pulumi commands
    working-directory: packages/infra  # Explicit per step
```

3. **Secret Security** ✅
```yaml
# All secrets from GitHub Secrets, never hardcoded
pulumi config set --secret db:password "${{ secrets.DB_PASSWORD }}"
```

4. **Clear Error Messages** ✅
```yaml
- name: Pulumi Up
  run: |
    pulumi up --yes
    echo "✅ Infrastructure deployed successfully"
```

5. **Version Pinning** ✅
```yaml
- uses: actions/checkout@v4  # Not @main
- uses: actions/setup-node@v4
- uses: aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials@v4
```

## How to Deploy

### Manual Deployment

```bash
# 1. Set required secrets in GitHub repo settings:
#    - PULUMI_ACCESS_TOKEN
#    - AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
#    - AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
#    - DB_PASSWORD
#    - GITHUB_CLIENT_ID
#    - GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET

# 2. Go to Actions → Deploy Infrastructure (Pulumi + Beanstalk)

# 3. Click "Run workflow"
#    - Select stack: dev/staging/prod
#    - Select action: preview/up/destroy

# 4. For preview (safe):
#    - Stack: dev
#    - Action: preview
#    ⏱ Runs in ~2-3 minutes

# 5. For deployment:
#    - Stack: dev
#    - Action: up
#    ⏱ Runs in ~8-10 minutes
#    ✅ Creates all infrastructure
#    ✅ Runs health checks
#    ✅ Exports outputs

# 6. For teardown:
#    - Stack: dev
#    - Action: destroy
#    ⚠️  Destroys all infrastructure
```

### Automatic Deployment

```bash
# Push changes to packages/infra/**
git add packages/infra/
git commit -m "Update infrastructure"
git push origin main

# Workflow automatically:
# 1. Switches to Beanstalk configuration
# 2. Runs pulumi preview
# 3. (Manual approval required for 'up')
```

### Pre-Push Validation

```bash
# Always run before pushing workflow changes:
.github/scripts/validate-workflows.sh

# Fix any issues before committing
```
