🎯 **The Problem**:

PRPM provides:
- 784+ high-quality packages in one registry
- Cross-editor format conversion (works everywhere)
- npm-style package management (install, update, version control)
- 25+ curated collections for complete stacks

**Why we built this**:
We use Cursor and Claude Code daily. Managing prompts manually was painful. So we built the tool we wished existed.

**What makes it unique**:
- First cross-editor package manager
- Largest prompt collection (2.4x bigger than all Claude marketplaces combined)

Title: I built PRPM - npm for AI coding prompts (784+ packages for Cursor/Claude)

Hi everyone! 👋

**TL;DR**: I built a package manager for AI coding prompts. Install Cursor rules, Claude agents, and more with one command.

**The Problem I Faced**:
I use both Cursor and Claude Code. Managing prompts was a pain:
- Copy/paste from 7+ different GitHub repos
- Different formats (.cursorrules vs .claude/agents)
- No way to update or version prompts
- Hard to discover good prompts

**What I Built**:
PRPM (Prompt Package Manager) - think npm but for AI prompts.

**Features**:
✅ 784+ packages (Cursor rules, Claude agents, Windsurf rules)
✅ Works across all editors (auto-converts formats)
✅ One command install: `prpm install react-best-practices`
✅ 25+ curated collections (e.g., @collection/nextjs-pro)
✅ Version control and updates

**Example**:
```bash
npm install -g @prpm/cli
prpm search react
prpm install cursor-react-best-practices
prpm install @collection/python-backend-complete
```

**Open Source**: https://github.com/khaliqgant/prompt-package-manager

**Why I'm sharing**:
- Free and open source
- Hoping to make AI coding easier for everyone
- Looking for feedback and contributors

**Questions I'd love to answer**:
- What prompts do you use most?
- What features would you want?
- Any bugs or issues?

Would love your feedback! 🙏

**Stats**:
- 784 packages (vs Claude's 313 across 7 repos)
- Works in Cursor, Claude Code, Continue, Windsurf
- Central registry (launching at prmp.dev soon)
```
