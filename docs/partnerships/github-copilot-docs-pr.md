# GitHub Copilot Documentation PR - Marketing Partnership

## Objective

Submit a PR to GitHub's official Copilot documentation to mention PRPM as a package manager for GitHub Copilot instructions, establishing PRPM as a recognized tool in the Copilot ecosystem.

## Target Documentation

**Repository**: `github/docs`

**File**: `data/reusables/copilot/prompt-files-preview-note.md`

**URL**: https://github.com/github/docs/blob/main/data/reusables/copilot/prompt-files-preview-note.md

**Current Content**:
The file references "Awesome GitHub Copilot Customizations" repository for community-contributed prompt file examples.

## Proposed Changes

### Option 1: Direct Mention in Documentation

Add PRPM to the prompt files note as an official package manager:

```markdown
{% data variables.product.prodname_copilot_short %} prompt files are in {% data variables.release-phases.public_preview %} and subject to change.

For community-contributed prompt file examples, see the [Awesome GitHub Copilot Customizations](https://github.com/awesome-github-copilot-customizations) repository.

For managing and distributing Copilot instructions as packages, see [PRPM (Prompt Package Manager)](https://prpm.dev).
```

### Option 2: Addition to Awesome GitHub Copilot Customizations

If direct documentation mention isn't accepted, add PRPM to the referenced "Awesome GitHub Copilot Customizations" repository instead.

## Value Proposition

### For GitHub Users

1. **Package Management**: Users can install, share, and version Copilot instructions
2. **Discoverability**: Browse registry of community-contributed instructions at registry.prpm.dev
3. **Standardization**: Consistent format for sharing instructions across teams
4. **Format Conversion**: Convert between Copilot, Cursor, Claude, and other formats

### For GitHub/Microsoft

1. **Ecosystem Growth**: More tooling = more adoption of Copilot custom instructions
2. **Enterprise Adoption**: Package management encourages organizational sharing
3. **Community Contribution**: Lower barrier to sharing best practices
4. **Cross-Platform**: Shows Copilot instructions work well in multi-tool environments

## PRPM Capabilities for GitHub Copilot

### Current Support

- ✅ Import/export `.github/copilot-instructions.md` (repository-wide)
- ✅ Import/export `.github/instructions/*.instructions.md` (path-specific)
- ✅ Preserve `applyTo` glob patterns
- ✅ Convert to/from other formats (Cursor, Claude, Kiro, Continue, Windsurf)
- ✅ Public registry with search and discovery

### Example Usage

```bash
# Install a Copilot instruction package
prpm install @acme/react-copilot-instructions

# Search for Copilot instructions
prpm search "copilot react"

# Publish your own instructions
prpm publish

# Convert from other formats
prpm install @org/cursor-rules --as copilot
```

## Roadmap: Planned Copilot Support

- ⏳ AGENTS.md format support (for Copilot compatibility)
- ⏳ CLAUDE.md format support (for Copilot compatibility)
- ⏳ GEMINI.md format support (for Copilot compatibility)
- ⏳ Multi-file instruction packages
- ⏳ Instruction composition/inheritance
- ⏳ Validation of glob patterns

## PR Strategy

### Timing

- **Phase 1** (Q4 2024): Monitor Copilot prompt files graduation from preview
- **Phase 2** (Q1 2025): Submit PR when format stabilizes
- **Phase 3** (Q1 2025): Follow up with blog post collaboration

### Positioning

1. **Community Tool**: Position as community-driven, not competing with GitHub
2. **Ecosystem Enhancement**: Emphasize value-add to existing Copilot features
3. **Open Source**: Highlight open source nature and transparency
4. **Interoperability**: Show cross-platform support benefits all tools
