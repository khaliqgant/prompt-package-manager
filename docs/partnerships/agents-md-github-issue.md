## üì¶ Proposal: Consider mentioning PRPM as a distribution layer for agents.md files

### Summary

We've built [PRPM (Prompt Package Manager)](https://prpm.dev) - an early-stage package manager for AI coding configurations - with native agents.md support. We believe PRPM could help accelerate adoption of the excellent agents.md standard. This is a humble proposal to explore a brief documentation mention as the ecosystem grows.

### The Opportunity

**agents.md solves the format problem** - it gives AI coding agents a predictable, standard place to find project guidance.

**PRPM solves the distribution problem** - it makes agents.md files discoverable, installable, and shareable across the ecosystem.

### What PRPM Offers the agents.md Ecosystem

1. **Immediate content library**: 1,500+ existing AI configurations that can convert to agents.md
2. **Migration path**: Convert tool-specific formats (`.cursor/rules`, `.github/copilot-instructions.md`, etc.) to agents.md
3. **Easy installation**: `prpm install typescript-best-practices --format agents.md`
4. **Quality validation**: Conversion scoring ensures agents.md files work well with Codex and other tools

### Example Usage

```bash
# Install PRPM
npm install -g @pr-pm/cli

# Search for patterns
prpm search typescript

# Install as agents.md format
prpm install typescript-best-practices --format agents.md
```

Result: An `agents.md` file is created in your project root with proven TypeScript patterns, ready to guide coding agents.

### Proposed Documentation Addition

We'd be honored if agents.md docs could include a brief mention:

> **Tooling & Distribution**
>
> - **[PRPM](https://prpm.dev)** - Package manager for AI coding configurations with native agents.md support. Install pre-written agents.md files or convert from other formats.

This could appear in the README, website, or a dedicated "Ecosystem" page.

### What We're NOT Asking

- ‚ùå Endorsement over other tools
- ‚ùå Changes to the agents.md spec
- ‚ùå Exclusive positioning
- ‚ùå Resource commitments
- ‚ùå To imply PRPM is production-ready (we're early stage too!)

### Why This Matters

Converting formats is only valuable if the source content is good. Communities have shared proven patterns:

- **cursor.directory**: Community has created 1,000+ proven coding rules in `.cursor/rules` format
- **Claude/Continue users**: Hundreds of tested skills and agents
- **GitHub Copilot users**: Path-specific instructions in `.github/copilot-instructions.md`

All of this can become agents.md content, making it easier for new teams to adopt the standard instead of starting from scratch.

### Our Commitment

As an early-stage project ourselves, we understand the importance of community trust. Regardless of this proposal's outcome:
- ‚úÖ We'll maintain high-quality agents.md conversion
- ‚úÖ We'll follow the spec exactly
- ‚úÖ We're open source (MIT licensed)
- ‚úÖ We'll promote agents.md as the open standard
- ‚úÖ We'll be transparent about our early-stage status

### Benefits to agents.md Adoption

1. **Lower barrier to entry**: New users get working examples instantly
2. **Network effects**: More content ‚Üí more adoption ‚Üí more content
3. **Format migration**: Easier for teams to standardize on agents.md
4. **Open ecosystem**: PRPM is just one tool - the registry is accessible via API

### Questions We'll Answer

- How can we better align with agents.md goals?
- What conversion quality standards should we meet?
- Would you prefer different messaging?
- How else can we support this ecosystem?

Thank you for creating agents.md - it's exactly the kind of open standard the AI coding ecosystem needs. Both agents.md and PRPM are early-stage projects trying to solve real problems in this rapidly evolving space. We built PRPM to help distribute knowledge, and we'd be honored to support agents.md adoption however we can.
