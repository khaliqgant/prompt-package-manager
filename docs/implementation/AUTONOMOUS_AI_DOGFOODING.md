# Autonomous AI Self-Improvement with PRPM

## The Vision

AI assistants (Claude, Cursor, Windsurf, Continue) should **automatically discover and install** relevant PRPM packages as they work, making themselves smarter without manual intervention.

## Example Workflow

```
User: "Help me build a Pulumi + Beanstalk infrastructure"

AI thinks:
  1. This is about infrastructure → Search PRPM for "pulumi" packages
  2. Found: @prpm/pulumi-infrastructure collection
  3. Auto-install: prpm install @collection/pulumi-infrastructure
  4. Now I have Pulumi best practices loaded!
  5. Use those patterns to help the user

User: "Now add GitHub Actions for deployment"

AI thinks:
  1. Need CI/CD knowledge → Search PRPM for "github actions"
  2. Found: @sanjeed5/cursor-github-actions
  3. Auto-install: prpm install @sanjeed5/cursor-github-actions
  4. Now I know GitHub Actions best practices!
  5. Apply workflow validation patterns from the package
```

**Result**: AI gets smarter as it works, automatically pulling in domain expertise.

## Why This is Powerful

### 1. **Self-Improving AI**
- AI doesn't need all knowledge upfront
- Dynamically loads expertise when needed
- Gets better over time as more packages are added

### 2. **Reduced Context Window Waste**
- Only load relevant knowledge when needed
- Don't clutter context with unused packages
- Just-in-time knowledge delivery

### 3. **Always Up-to-Date**
- Pull latest best practices from PRPM registry
- Community-maintained knowledge base
- No stale built-in knowledge

### 4. **Discovers Unknown Solutions**
- User says "build X" → AI searches PRPM for X-related packages
- Finds packages the user didn't know existed
- Suggests: "I found these relevant packages, should I install them?"

---

## Implementation Approaches

### Approach 1: Meta-Package (Recommended ⭐)
**One package per IDE that enables autonomous behavior**

```
Package IDs:
- @prpm/autonomous-claude-skill
- @prpm/autonomous-cursor-rule  
- @prpm/autonomous-windsurf-rule
- @prpm/autonomous-continue-agent
```

**What it does:**
1. Instructs AI to search PRPM before starting tasks
2. Provides search/install command patterns
3. Defines when to auto-install vs ask user
4. Sets up feedback loop (track what packages helped)

**Example Package Content** (`@prpm/autonomous-claude-skill`):

```markdown
# Autonomous Package Discovery Skill

## Core Behavior

Before starting any technical task:
1. Analyze the task for key domains (infra, testing, deployment, etc.)
2. Search PRPM registry for relevant packages
3. Present top 3 matches to user
4. Install if approved (or auto-install if high confidence)

## Search Triggers

- **Infrastructure keywords**: pulumi, terraform, aws, kubernetes, docker
  → Search: `prpm search <keyword>`
  
- **Testing keywords**: playwright, jest, vitest, cypress
  → Search: `prpm search testing <framework>`
  
- **Deployment keywords**: github-actions, ci/cd, deployment
  → Search: `prpm search deployment`

- **Framework keywords**: react, vue, next.js, express
  → Search: `prpm search <framework>`

## Auto-Install vs Ask

### Auto-install (high confidence):
- Official packages (marked as `official: true`)
- Featured packages (marked as `featured: true`)
- High download count (>1000 downloads)
- Collections curated by PRPM team

### Ask user first (medium confidence):
- Community packages with <1000 downloads
- Multiple similar packages found
- Package seems tangentially related

### Never auto-install:
- Unverified packages from unknown authors
- Packages with security warnings
- Deprecated packages

## Installation Pattern

```bash
# Search
prpm search "pulumi aws" --limit 5

# Review results with user
"I found these relevant packages:
1. @prpm/pulumi-infrastructure (Official, 5.2K downloads)
2. @sanjeed5/pulumi-aws (Community, 892 downloads)
Should I install #1 to help with this task?"

# Install after approval
prpm install @prpm/pulumi-infrastructure --as claude

# Confirm
"✅ Installed Pulumi infrastructure package. 
I now have access to Pulumi + AWS best practices."
```

## Feedback Loop

After task completion:
1. Track which packages were used
2. Rate package helpfulness (1-5)
3. Report back to registry (optional telemetry)
4. Suggest related packages for future use

## Example Interaction

User: "Build a REST API with Express and MongoDB"

AI (internal):
  1. Keywords detected: "REST API", "Express", "MongoDB"
  2. Search PRPM: prpm search "express mongodb api"
  3. Found: @sanjeed5/express (High quality, 2.3K downloads)
  4. High confidence → Suggest to user

AI (to user):
"I found a relevant package that can help:
- **@sanjeed5/express** - Express.js best practices (2.3K downloads)
  
Should I install it? This will give me access to Express + MongoDB patterns."

User: "Yes"

AI:
  1. prpm install @sanjeed5/express --as claude
  2. Load package knowledge
  3. Apply Express best practices to code generation
  4. ✅ Better code quality from domain expertise
```

---

### Approach 2: Collection per Domain
**Pre-made collections for common domains**

```
Collections:
- @collection/autonomous-infrastructure
- @collection/autonomous-testing
- @collection/autonomous-deployment
- @collection/autonomous-frontend
- @collection/autonomous-backend
```

**What it does:**
- Each collection contains the "autonomous" skill + domain packages
- AI installs entire collection when entering a domain
- One-time setup, continuous benefit

**Example**: `@collection/autonomous-infrastructure`
```json
{
  "id": "autonomous-infrastructure",
  "name": "Autonomous Infrastructure AI",
  "description": "Self-improving AI for infrastructure tasks",
  "packages": [
    "autonomous-claude-skill",      // Core autonomous behavior
    "pulumi-infrastructure",        // Pulumi knowledge
    "github-actions",               // CI/CD knowledge  
    "terraform-aws",                // Terraform knowledge
    "kubernetes-deployment"         // K8s knowledge
  ]
}
```

**User installs once:**
```bash
prpm install @collection/autonomous-infrastructure
```

**Result:**
- AI can now handle any infrastructure task
- Automatically applies best practices from 4+ packages
- Self-improves as more packages are added to collection

---

### Approach 3: IDE-Native Integration
**Built into IDE via extension/plugin**

**For Claude Code:**
- Custom MCP server: `@prpm/autonomous-mcp-server`
- Exposes PRPM search/install as MCP tools
- Claude automatically calls MCP tools when needed

**For Cursor:**
- `.cursorrules` file with autonomous behavior
- Cursor follows rules automatically
- Calls `prpm search` and `prpm install` via terminal

**For Windsurf:**
- Cascade skill with PRPM integration
- Windsurf proactively searches PRPM
- Suggests packages before user asks

---

## Recommended Strategy

### Phase 1: Meta-Packages (Immediate)
Create one package per IDE:
1. **@prpm/autonomous-claude-skill** ← Claude Code
2. **@prpm/autonomous-cursor-rule** ← Cursor
3. **@prpm/autonomous-windsurf-cascade** ← Windsurf
4. **@prpm/autonomous-continue-agent** ← Continue

Each teaches the AI to:
- Search PRPM for relevant packages
- Install when appropriate
- Apply learned knowledge to tasks

### Phase 2: Domain Collections (1-2 weeks)
Build 5-10 domain collections:
- `@collection/autonomous-infrastructure`
- `@collection/autonomous-testing`
- `@collection/autonomous-deployment`
- `@collection/autonomous-frontend`
- `@collection/autonomous-backend`

### Phase 3: Native Integration (1-2 months)
- MCP server for Claude Code
- Cursor extension
- Windsurf plugin
- Continue integration

## Package Structure Example

### `@prpm/autonomous-claude-skill`

**File: `autonomous-claude-skill.md`**

```markdown
# Autonomous Package Discovery for Claude

## Mission
Proactively discover and use PRPM packages to enhance your capabilities.

## When to Search PRPM

### Infrastructure Tasks
Keywords: aws, gcp, azure, kubernetes, docker, pulumi, terraform
→ `prpm search infrastructure <cloud-provider>`

### Testing Tasks
Keywords: test, playwright, jest, cypress, vitest
→ `prpm search testing <framework>`

### Deployment/CI/CD
Keywords: deploy, ci/cd, github actions, gitlab ci, jenkins
→ `prpm search deployment`

### Framework-Specific
Keywords: react, vue, angular, next.js, express, fastify
→ `prpm search <framework>`

## Decision Tree

```
User requests task
    ↓
Identify domain (infra, testing, etc.)
    ↓
Search PRPM: `prpm search <domain> <keywords>`
    ↓
Found packages?
    ├─ Yes → Review top 3 results
    │        ↓
    │    Is it official/featured/high-downloads?
    │        ├─ Yes → Suggest to user: "Should I install X?"
    │        └─ No → Show results, let user decide
    │             ↓
    │         User approves?
    │             ├─ Yes → `prpm install <package> --as claude`
    │             │        Load package knowledge
    │             │        Apply to task ✅
    │             └─ No → Proceed without package
    └─ No → Proceed with built-in knowledge
```

## Example Commands

### Search for Packages
```bash
# General search
prpm search "github actions deployment"

# By category
prpm search --category devops

# By type
prpm search --type claude

# By tags
prpm search --tags pulumi,aws
```

### Install Package
```bash
# Install as Claude skill
prpm install @sanjeed5/github-actions --as claude

# Install collection
prpm install @collection/pulumi-infrastructure --as claude

# Install specific version
prpm install @prpm/testing-patterns@1.2.0 --as claude
```

### List Installed
```bash
prpm list
```

## Success Metrics

Track and report (if telemetry enabled):
- Packages searched per task
- Packages installed
- Package helpfulness rating (1-5)
- Task success rate with vs without packages

## Privacy Note

All package searches/installs are local. No data sent to PRPM unless:
- User explicitly enables telemetry
- User downloads packages (download count incremented)
```
