# Verified Plan UI Implementation

This document describes the comprehensive UI components for advertising and managing verified organization subscriptions.

## Overview

We've implemented a complete user interface for promoting and managing verified organization plans. The UI includes multiple components that work together to:

1. **Advertise** the verified plan benefits to non-verified organizations
2. **Display detailed information** about all features included in the plan
3. **Enable easy upgrades** through Stripe Checkout integration
4. **Manage subscriptions** for existing verified organizations

## Components

### 1. VerifiedPlanBenefits (`components/VerifiedPlanBenefits.tsx`)

**Purpose**: Comprehensive list of all benefits included in the verified plan.

**Features**:
- 16 detailed benefits organized by category:
  - Core Benefits (verified badge, custom avatar, priority ranking)
  - Publishing & Packages (private packages, auto-verified, featured slots)
  - Team Collaboration (20 members, role-based permissions, audit logs)
  - Analytics & Insights (advanced analytics, trend insights, data exports)
  - Support & Resources (priority support, direct messaging, exclusive resources)
- Two display modes:
  - **Full mode**: All benefits with descriptions, categorized
  - **Compact mode**: Top 6 benefits for quick preview
- Optional pricing display

**Usage**:
```tsx
// Full display
<VerifiedPlanBenefits showPricing={true} />

// Compact preview
<VerifiedPlanBenefits compact={true} />
```

## Integration Points

3. Upgrade banner below organization header (for non-verified orgs with edit permissions)
4. Upgrade modal at bottom of page

**Implementation**:
```tsx
{/* Upgrade Banner for Non-Verified Organizations */}
{!organization.is_verified && canEdit && (
  <div className="bg-prpm-dark border-b border-prpm-border">
    <div className="max-w-7xl mx-auto px-6 py-6">
      <UpgradePrompt
        organizationName={organization.name}
        jwtToken={jwtToken}
        variant="banner"
      />
    </div>
