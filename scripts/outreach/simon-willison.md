## Outreach Plan

### Phase 1: Email (Week 1)

**Subject**: PRMP - Package Manager for Claude Skills & Prompts

**Body**:

```
Hi Simon,

I just read your excellent article on Claude Skills (https://simonwillison.net/2025/Oct/16/claude-skills/) and wanted to share something I think you'll find interesting.

I'm building PRMP (Prompt Package Manager) - an npm-like CLI for distributing Claude skills, cursor rules, and AI prompts. Your article actually describes the exact problem PRMP solves: how to discover, share, and manage reusable AI instructions.

## What is PRMP?

Instead of copying skills from GitHub or manually creating them:

```bash
# Install a Claude skill
prpm install react-expert-skill

# Publish your own
prpm publish

# Search for skills
prpm search "data analysis"
```

## Why I'm reaching out

1. **Your Use Case**: The skills you described in your article would be perfect PRPM packages
2. **Distribution**: Make your skills easily discoverable and installable
3. **Feedback**: Would love your thoughts on the project
4. **Early Access**: Invite you to be one of the first verified creators

The registry launches next week with 100+ cursor rules and Claude skills. I'd be honored to include any skills/prompts you'd like to share, or just get your feedback on the project.

## Links

- **GitHub**: https://github.com/pr-pm/prpm
- **Demo**: [video or screenshots]
- **Docs**: [link to docs]

Would love to hear your thoughts! Happy to jump on a call if you're interested.

Best,
Khaliq

P.S. If you're interested, I can set you up with early access before the public launch.
```

### Phase 2: Twitter (Day 2-3)

**Tweet 1** (Quote his article):

```
💡 Just read @simonw's excellent piece on Claude Skills

Built exactly what he describes - a package manager for prompts:

npm install -g prpm
prpm install react-expert-skill

Like npm, but for Claude skills, cursor rules, and AI prompts.

Launching next week with 100+ packages.

```

**Tweet 2** (Follow-up with demo):

```
@simonw Demo of installing the Claude skills you described:

Would love your feedback! Early access available.

github.com/khaliqgant/prpm
```

### Phase 3: Hacker News Comment (Week 2)

When he posts next article (or post yourself):

```
Relevant to this - I just launched PRMP (Prompt Package Manager):

npm install -g prpm
prpm install react-expert-skill

Like npm but for Claude skills, cursor rules, and prompts. Simon's article on Claude Skills (https://simonwillison.net/2025/Oct/16/claude-skills/) inspired part of the design.

100+ packages available, growing daily.

Would love HN's feedback: github.com/pr-pm/prpm
```

```
🚀 Excited to announce @simonw is now on PRPM!

His Claude skills are now installable via:

prpm install simonw-data-analysis

Thanks Simon for being an early supporter! 🙏

This is exactly what PRPM is about - making AI skills as easy to share as npm packages.

## Notes

- Be genuine - he's allergic to marketing BS
- Technical depth - he appreciates detail
- Show, don't tell - demos > explanations
- Respect his time - concise, clear, actionable
- Provide value first - don't just ask

---

## Backup Plan

If he's not interested or doesn't respond:
1. Still reference his article in docs (with credit)
2. Build the Claude Skills support he described
3. Show, not tell - let the product speak
4. Reach out again in 3 months with traction
