**Date:** 2025-10-19
**All Known Issues:** RESOLVED ✅

---

## 📋 Issues Fixed Checklist

### ✅ Issue 1: Missing `official` Column
**Problem:** Benchmark queries referenced `official` column that didn't exist
**Impact:** Benchmark tests failed with "column does not exist" error

**Fix Applied:**
1. Created migration `003_add_official_column.sql`
2. Added `official BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE` column
3. Created index `idx_packages_official_flag`

**Files Modified:**
- `migrations/003_add_official_column.sql` (created)

**Validation:**
```sql
SELECT official, COUNT(*) FROM packages GROUP BY official;
-- Result: 3 official, 719 non-official ✅
```

**Status:** ✅ FIXED

---

### ✅ Issue 2: Missing `downloads` Column Reference
**Problem:** Benchmark referenced `downloads` column instead of `total_downloads`
**Impact:** Query errors in benchmark tests

**Fix Applied:**
1. Updated `benchmark-search.sql` to use `total_downloads`
2. Added `NULLS LAST` to quality_score sorting

**Files Modified:**
- `benchmark-search.sql` (lines 274, 277, 287)

**Changes:**
```sql
-- Before
SELECT ... downloads ...
ORDER BY quality_score DESC, downloads DESC

-- After
SELECT ... total_downloads ...
ORDER BY quality_score DESC NULLS LAST, total_downloads DESC
```

**Validation:**
- ✅ Test 18 runs without errors
- ✅ Test 19 runs without errors

**Status:** ✅ FIXED

---

### ✅ Issue 3: pg_stat_user_indexes Column Name Error
**Problem:** Query used `tablename` instead of `relname`
**Impact:** Statistics queries failed

**Fix Applied:**
1. Changed `tablename` to `relname as tablename` in both stats queries
2. Updated both index and table statistics queries

**Files Modified:**
- `benchmark-search.sql` (lines 309, 316, 325, 332)

**Changes:**
```sql
-- Before
SELECT tablename, indexname ...
FROM pg_stat_user_indexes

-- After
SELECT relname as tablename, indexrelname as indexname ...
FROM pg_stat_user_indexes
```

**Validation:**
- ✅ Index statistics query works
- ✅ Table statistics query works

**Status:** ✅ FIXED

---

### ✅ Issue 4: API Search Not Filtering Results
**Problem:** Search parameter existed in API but didn't filter results
**Impact:** Search returned all 722 packages regardless of search term

**Fix Applied:**
1. Added `search` field to `ListPackagesQuery` interface
2. Implemented search filtering with:
   - Full-text search (websearch_to_tsquery)
   - ILIKE pattern matching
   - Tag matching
3. Rebuilt Docker container with new code
4. Cleared Redis cache

**Files Modified:**
- `src/types/requests.ts` (added `search?: string`)
- `src/routes/packages.ts` (added search condition logic)

**Implementation:**
```typescript
if (search) {
  conditions.push(`(
    to_tsvector('english', coalesce(display_name, '') || ' ' || coalesce(description, ''))
      @@ websearch_to_tsquery('english', $${paramIndex}) OR
    display_name ILIKE $${paramIndex + 1} OR
    $${paramIndex + 2} = ANY(tags)
  )`);
  params.push(search, `%${search}%`, search.toLowerCase());
  paramIndex += 3;
}
```

**Validation:**
```bash
# Search for 'react'
curl "http://localhost:3000/api/v1/packages?search=react&limit=3"
# Result: 59 packages (filtered correctly) ✅

# Search for 'python'
curl "http://localhost:3000/api/v1/packages?search=python&limit=3"
# Result: 83 packages (filtered correctly) ✅
```

**Status:** ✅ FIXED

### ✅ Issue 5: Official/Verified Packages Not Populated
**Problem:** Official flag existed but no packages were marked as official
**Impact:** Official packages couldn't be identified

**Fix Applied:**
1. Updated seed script to detect official packages
2. Logic: Mark as official if:
   - `pkg.official === true` OR
   - Filename includes 'official' OR
   - Author is 'cursor-directory' OR
   - Author is 'anthropic'
3. Mark as verified if official or explicitly verified

**Files Modified:**
- `scripts/seed-packages.ts` (added isOfficial/isVerified logic)

**Implementation:**
```typescript
const isOfficial = !!(pkg.official ||
  file.includes('official') ||
  author === 'cursor-directory' ||
  author === 'anthropic');

const isVerified = !!(pkg.verified || pkg.official);
```

**Validation:**
```sql
SELECT id, official, verified FROM packages WHERE official = true;
-- Result:
--   @cursor-directory/trpc-official (official: true, verified: true)
--   @cursor-directory/supabase-auth-official (official: true, verified: true)
--   @cursor-directory/trigger-tasks-official (official: true, verified: true)
-- ✅ 3 official packages correctly marked
```

**Status:** ✅ FIXED
