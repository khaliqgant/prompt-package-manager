# 🔥 Karen's Brutally Honest Review

**Repository:** prpm
**Karen Score:** 🚨 **42/100** - "Needs intervention"
**Reviewed:** 10/24/2025, 8:19:38 PM

## The Reality Check

PRPM tackles a real problem - the AI prompt ecosystem is indeed a copy-paste nightmare from random GitHub repos - but this is a masterclass in premature optimization and scope creep. You've built an entire monorepo with 473 files, a full registry backend, webapp, telemetry system, and format converters for a problem that could be solved with a simple package.json and npm. The core CLI barely works, format conversion is half-implemented with TODO stubs, the webapp is full of 'Coming Soon' placeholders, and you're tracking telemetry for users who can't even use half your features. It's like building AWS when people just need a file server.

## What Actually Works

- Core CLI install/uninstall commands function
- PostgreSQL schema is well-designed
- TypeScript types are properly structured
- Monorepo organization is clean

---

## The Bullshit Detector Went Off

### 🚨 Critical Issues

**Missing Functionality**: Format converters are placeholders - core value proposition is broken
- 📁 `packages/registry/src/routes/convert.ts:89`
- 💡 **Fix:** Actually implement Continue and Windsurf converters instead of TODO comments

**Incomplete Work**: Webapp dashboard features are disabled with 'Coming soon' messages
- 📁 `packages/webapp/src/app/(app)/dashboard/page.tsx:251`
- 💡 **Fix:** Either implement web publishing or remove the UI entirely - don't ship broken features

**Missing Functionality**: 105 TODOs throughout codebase indicate massive incompleteness
- 📁 `GAP_ANALYSIS.md:18`
- 💡 **Fix:** Address critical TODOs before claiming production readiness

### ⚠️ High Priority

**Over-Engineering**: Complex telemetry system for a CLI tool with minimal user base
- 📁 `packages/registry/src/telemetry/index.ts:1`
- 💡 **Fix:** Strip down to basic usage stats until you have actual users

**Over-Engineering**: Full monorepo with registry backend for what npm already does
- 📁 `packages/registry/src/index.ts:1`
- 💡 **Fix:** Consider if a simple npm organization would solve 80% of this problem

**Quality Issues**: Authentication flow has missing admin checks in invite routes
- 📁 `packages/registry/src/routes/invites.ts:4`
- 💡 **Fix:** Implement proper admin authorization before shipping invite system

### 📝 Medium Priority

**Questionable Value**: Karen review integration feels like narcissistic marketing gimmick
- 📁 `.karen/review.md:1`
- 💡 **Fix:** Focus on core functionality before viral marketing features

**Missing Functionality**: CLI tar extraction is incomplete and unreliable
- 📁 `packages/cli/src/commands/install.ts:1`
- 💡 **Fix:** Implement proper tar extraction with established libraries



---

## The Bottom Line

> You're solving a real problem but built a Space Shuttle when people need a bicycle - strip out 70% of this complexity and ship something that actually works.

---

## Karen's Prescription

1. Complete the format converters or remove the multi-format claims entirely
2. Remove all 'Coming Soon' UI and ship only working features
3. Consider pivoting to a simple npm organization structure instead of custom registry
4. Address the 105 TODOs before adding any new features
5. Simplify to CLI-only until core functionality is bulletproof
