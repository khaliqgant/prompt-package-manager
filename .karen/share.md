Karen just reviewed my project and gave it a 78/100 âœ…

"Actually decent"

First-mover advantage in a real market gap, but you're racing against discovery - someone will fork this if you don't move fast enough.

Just got an AI-powered code review from Karen (our new brutally honest repository reviewer).

Score: 78/100 âœ… "Actually decent"

Key insight: We're first-to-market with a CLI package manager for Cursor rules and Claude agents. Nobody else is doing semantic versioning + registry for AI prompts.

But Karen's warning is real - first-mover advantage means nothing if we don't move fast enough.
