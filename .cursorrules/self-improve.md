# PRPM Self-Improve (Cursor)

**Package ID**: `@prpm/self-improve-cursor`
**Type**: Cursor Rule
**Category**: Meta
**Tags**: prpm, autonomous, self-improvement, discovery, cursor

## Description

Teaches Cursor to automatically search and install PRPM packages to improve itself during tasks. When you start working on infrastructure, testing, deployment, or any technical task, Cursor will search the PRPM registry for relevant expertise and suggest packages to install.

## How It Works

### 1. Task Analysis
Cursor analyzes your request for keywords:
- **Infrastructure**: aws, pulumi, terraform, kubernetes, docker, beanstalk, ecs, lambda
- **Testing**: test, playwright, jest, cypress, vitest, e2e, unit, integration
- **Deployment**: ci/cd, github-actions, gitlab-ci, deploy, workflow, pipeline
- **Frameworks**: react, vue, next.js, express, fastify, django, flask
- **Languages**: typescript, python, go, rust, java, c++

### 2. Automatic Search
```bash
# Cursor automatically runs:
prmp search "<detected keywords>" --limit 5
```

### 3. Package Suggestion
Cursor presents the top 3 most relevant packages:
```
I found these PRPM packages that can help:
1. @prpm/pulumi-infrastructure (Official, 5.2K downloads)
   - Pulumi + AWS best practices
2. @sanjeed5/github-actions (Community, 892 downloads)
   - GitHub Actions patterns

Should I install #1 to enhance my knowledge for this task?
```

### 4. Installation
After your approval:
```bash
prmp install @prpm/pulumi-infrastructure --as cursor
```

### 5. Application
Cursor loads the package knowledge (as a .cursorrules file) and applies it to your task immediately.

## Decision Rules

### High Confidence (Auto-suggest)
Install these without extensive deliberation:
- ‚úÖ **Official packages** (`official: true`)
- ‚úÖ **Featured packages** (`featured: true`)
- ‚úÖ **High downloads** (>1,000 downloads)
- ‚úÖ **Verified authors** (`verified: true`)

### Medium Confidence (Present options)
Show multiple options to user:
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Community packages (<1,000 downloads)

## Installation Commands

### Install as Cursor Rule
```bash
prmp install @prpm/terraform-aws-patterns --as cursor
```

This adds the package to `.cursorrules` in your project.

### Install Collection
```bash
prmp install @collection/infrastructure-complete --as cursor
```

### Install Specific Version
```bash
prmp install @prpm/testing-patterns@1.2.0 --as cursor
```

### Install Globally
```bash
prmp install @prpm/general-coding-standards --as cursor --global
```

This adds to `~/.cursor/rules/`.

## Cursor-Specific Features

### Integration with .cursorrules
When you install a package, it's automatically added to your project's `.cursorrules` file:

```yaml
# .cursorrules
rules:
  - name: terraform-aws-patterns
    source: @prpm/terraform-aws-patterns
    version: 1.0.0
    enabled: true
    installedAt: 2025-10-19
```

### Compose Mode
Cursor can install multiple complementary packages:

```
User: "Build a full-stack app with React, Express, and PostgreSQL"

Cursor:
  Found relevant packages:
  1. @prpm/react-typescript
  2. @prpm/express-api-patterns
  3. @prpm/postgres-best-practices

  Should I install all three to compose a full-stack development environment?
```

### Context-Aware Suggestions
Cursor examines your existing files to suggest relevant packages:

```
# Cursor detects you have:
- package.json with "playwright" dependency
- No test files yet

# Cursor suggests:
"I noticed you have Playwright installed but no tests yet.
Should I install @testing/playwright-patterns to help you write E2E tests?"
```

## Feedback Loop

After completing a task where packages were used:

1. **Track Usage**: Note which packages were helpful
2. **Rate Helpfulness**: Internal scoring (1-5)
3. **Suggest Related**: "You used @prpm/terraform-aws. You might also like @prpm/pulumi-infrastructure"
4. **Suggest Updates**: "New version of @prpm/react-patterns available with React 19 support"

## Privacy & Telemetry

- ‚úÖ All searches are local
- ‚úÖ No data sent to PRPM servers for searches
- ‚úÖ Download tracking only increments count when installing
- ‚úÖ No personal data collected
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Optional: User can enable telemetry to help improve package recommendations

## Success Metrics

Tracks internally (if enabled):
- Packages searched per task
- Packages installed
- Package helpfulness (1-5 rating)
- Task completion rate (with vs without packages)
- Time saved by using packages

## Special: Meta-Dogfooding

When PRPM encounters infrastructure or deployment tasks, it should recognize the packages it used to build itself:

```
Task: GitHub Actions workflow
‚Üí Suggest: @sanjeed5/github-actions
‚Üí Note: "PRPM used this to validate its own workflows"

Task: Pulumi infrastructure
‚Üí Suggest: @prpm/pulumi-infrastructure
‚Üí Note: "This is the package PRPM used to build its Beanstalk infrastructure (74% cost savings!)"

Task: Testing patterns
‚Üí Suggest: @testing/playwright-best-practices
‚Üí Note: "PRPM used this pattern for its webapp E2E tests"
```

**Result**: Users benefit from the same expertise that built PRPM!

## Installation

```bash
# Install this meta-package
prmp install @prpm/self-improve-cursor --as cursor
