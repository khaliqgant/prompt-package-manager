# Introducing PRPM: A Universal Package Manager for AI Coding Tools

I've been working on solving a problem I kept running into: managing prompts, rules, and agents across different AI coding tools like Cursor, Claude Code, Continue, and Windsurf.

**The Problem**: Every tool has its own format and location for storing prompts/rules. Finding good ones meant browsing GitHub repos, copying files manually, and dealing with different formats.

**The Solution**: PRPM - a universal package manager that works across all major AI coding tools.

## What it does:
- üì¶ Centralized registry with 1500+ packages
- üîç Search and discover prompts/rules/agents
- ‚¨áÔ∏è Install with one command: `prpm install package-name`
- üîÑ Automatic format conversion
- üìä Quality scoring and trending packages
- üéØ Collections for curated sets

## Try it:
```bash
npm install -g prpm
prpm search react
prpm install @cursor-directory/react-typescript
```

Browse packages: https://prpm.dev

Would love feedback from the community!
