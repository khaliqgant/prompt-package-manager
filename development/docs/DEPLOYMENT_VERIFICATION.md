# PRPM Deployment Verification Checklist

This checklist ensures all deployment logic is clear and all necessary environment variables are properly configured.

## ✅ Deployment Logic Verification

### Infrastructure Deployment (`deploy-pulumi-beanstalk.yml`)

- [x] **Workflow triggers:**
  - [x] Push to `main` on `packages/infra/**` changes
  - [x] Manual workflow dispatch with environment selection

- [x] **Pre-deployment:**
  - [x] AWS credentials configured
  - [x] Pulumi dependencies installed
  - [x] Beanstalk configuration file selected (`index.ts`)

- [x] **Pulumi configuration:**
  - [x] Stack selected/created (dev/staging/prod)
  - [x] AWS region set (`us-west-2`)
  - [x] Database credentials configured from secrets
  - [x] GitHub OAuth credentials configured from secrets
  - [x] JWT secret configured from secrets ✅ **NEW**
  - [x] Beanstalk instance settings configured
  - [x] Domain configuration (if applicable)

- [x] **Deployment actions:**
  - [x] Preview mode shows changes
  - [x] Up mode deploys infrastructure
  - [x] Destroy mode tears down infrastructure
  - [x] Skip preview on `up` for faster deployment

- [x] **Post-deployment:**
  - [x] Stack outputs exported
  - [x] Outputs saved as artifacts
  - [x] Environment details displayed

- [x] **Error handling:**
  - [x] Notification on failure
  - [x] Proper exit codes

### Application Deployment (`deploy-registry.yml`)

- [x] **Workflow triggers:**
  - [x] Push to `main` on `packages/registry/**` or `packages/types/**` changes
  - [x] Manual workflow dispatch with environment selection

- [x] **Pre-deployment checks:**
  - [x] Environment exists ✅ **CRITICAL**
  - [x] Environment status is "Ready" ✅ **CRITICAL**
  - [x] Environment health checked (warns if Red) ✅ **CRITICAL**
  - [x] Fails if environment not found or not ready

- [x] **Build process:**
  - [x] Node.js 20 installed
  - [x] Dependencies installed (root, registry, types)
  - [x] TypeScript compiled to JavaScript
  - [x] Build verified (`dist/` directory exists)
  - [x] Dev dependencies pruned

- [x] **Package creation:**
  - [x] Version label: `v{run_number}-{git_sha_short}`
  - [x] Includes: `dist/`, `node_modules/`, `package.json`, `.ebextensions/`, `migrations/`
  - [x] Excludes: tests, docs, git files, `.md` files

- [x] **Deployment process:**
  - [x] Upload package to S3
  - [x] Create Beanstalk application version
  - [x] Save current version for rollback
  - [x] Deploy to environment
  - [x] Wait for deployment (up to 15 minutes) ✅ **CRITICAL**
  - [x] Poll every 10 seconds
  - [x] Check status and health
  - [x] Verify version updated

- [x] **Health verification:**
  - [x] Test `/health` endpoint ✅ **CRITICAL**
  - [x] Test `/api/v1/packages` endpoint ✅ **CRITICAL**
  - [x] Retry up to 30 times (5 minutes)
  - [x] Auto-rollback on failure ✅ **CRITICAL**

- [x] **Post-deployment:**
  - [x] Deployment summary displayed
  - [x] Cleanup old versions (keep last 10)
  - [x] Delete old S3 packages
  - [x] Skip deletion if version in use

- [x] **Error handling:**
  - [x] Timeout after 15 minutes
  - [x] Fail on Red health
  - [x] Fail on version mismatch
  - [x] Display recent error events
  - [x] Notification on failure

### Deployment Safety Features

- [x] **Concurrency control:**
  - [x] Prevent concurrent deployments to same environment
  - [x] `cancel-in-progress: false` (waits for previous)

- [x] **Rollback mechanisms:**
  - [x] Automatic rollback on health check failure
  - [x] Previous version tracked
  - [x] Manual rollback possible via AWS CLI

- [x] **Health monitoring:**
  - [x] Environment health checked before deployment
  - [x] Application health verified after deployment
  - [x] Multiple retry attempts

- [x] **Zero-downtime deployment:**
  - [x] Rolling deployment policy (50% batch size)
  - [x] Additional batch during update
  - [x] Load balancer continues serving old instances

## ✅ Environment Variables Configuration

### GitHub Secrets Required

- [x] `PULUMI_ACCESS_TOKEN` - Pulumi Cloud access
- [x] `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` - AWS credentials
- [x] `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` - AWS credentials
- [x] `DB_PASSWORD` - PostgreSQL password
- [x] `GITHUB_CLIENT_ID` - GitHub OAuth client ID
- [x] `GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET` - GitHub OAuth secret
- [x] `JWT_SECRET` - JWT signing secret ✅ **NEW**

### Pulumi Configuration Flow

- [x] **GitHub Secrets → Pulumi Config:**
  - [x] `db:password` from `DB_PASSWORD`
  - [x] `github:clientId` from `GITHUB_CLIENT_ID`
  - [x] `github:clientSecret` from `GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET`
  - [x] `jwt:secret` from `JWT_SECRET` ✅ **NEW**

- [x] **Pulumi Index.ts reads config:**
  - [x] `dbConfig.password = config.requireSecret("db:password")`
  - [x] `githubOAuth.clientId = config.requireSecret("github:clientId")`
  - [x] `githubOAuth.clientSecret = config.requireSecret("github:clientSecret")`
  - [x] `jwtConfig.secret = config.requireSecret("jwt:secret")` ✅ **NEW**

- [x] **Beanstalk Module receives:**
  - [x] `dbPassword: pulumi.Output<string>`
  - [x] `githubClientId: pulumi.Output<string>`
  - [x] `githubClientSecret: pulumi.Output<string>`
  - [x] `jwtSecret: pulumi.Output<string>` ✅ **NEW**

- [x] **Beanstalk environment variables set:**
  - [x] `NODE_ENV` - environment (production/staging/dev)
  - [x] `PORT` - 3000
  - [x] `DATABASE_URL` - constructed from RDS outputs
  - [x] `GITHUB_CLIENT_ID` - from Pulumi secret
  - [x] `GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET` - from Pulumi secret
  - [x] `GITHUB_CALLBACK_URL` - constructed from domain
  - [x] `AWS_S3_BUCKET` - from S3 module output
  - [x] `AWS_REGION` - us-west-2
  - [x] `JWT_SECRET` - from Pulumi secret ✅ **NEW**

### Application Environment Variable Usage

- [x] **Database connection (`src/config.ts`):**
  - [x] Reads `process.env.DATABASE_URL`
  - [x] Fallback to localhost for local dev

- [x] **JWT authentication (`src/config.ts`):**
  - [x] Reads `process.env.JWT_SECRET`
  - [x] Fallback to dev secret (should fail in prod if not set)

- [x] **GitHub OAuth (`src/config.ts`):**
  - [x] Reads `process.env.GITHUB_CLIENT_ID`
  - [x] Reads `process.env.GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET`
  - [x] No fallback (will fail if not set)

- [x] **S3 storage:**
  - [x] Reads `process.env.AWS_S3_BUCKET`
  - [x] Reads `process.env.AWS_REGION`
  - [x] Uses IAM role credentials (no keys in env)

## ✅ Migration Configuration

### Database Migrations (`packages/registry/.ebextensions/03_migrations.config`)

- [x] **Leader-only execution:**
  - [x] Migrations run only on one instance
  - [x] Prevents race conditions

- [x] **Migration steps:**
  - [x] Install dependencies (`npm ci --only=production`)
  - [x] Run migrations (`npm run migrate`)
  - [x] Verify schema (`psql -c "\dt"`)

- [x] **Environment variables:**
  - [x] `DATABASE_URL` passed to migration script
  - [x] Constructed by Pulumi from RDS outputs

- [x] **Error handling:**
  - [x] Schema verification ignores errors (non-critical)
  - [x] Migration errors will fail deployment

## ✅ Manual Deployment Prevention

- [x] **Removed manual deployment:**
  - [x] `packages/infra/scripts/deploy-beanstalk.sh` exists but not in npm scripts
  - [x] Removed `deploy` script from `packages/infra/package.json` ✅ **NEW**
  - [x] Removed `deploy:watch` script from `packages/infra/package.json` ✅ **NEW**

- [x] **Documentation:**
  - [x] `.github/workflows/README.md` created ✅ **NEW**
  - [x] Explains GitHub Actions workflow
  - [x] Documents deployment flow
  - [x] Provides troubleshooting guide
  - [x] Emphasizes GitHub Actions-only deployment

- [x] **Environment variables documentation:**
  - [x] `packages/infra/ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLES.md` created ✅ **NEW**
  - [x] Documents all environment variables
  - [x] Shows configuration flow
  - [x] Provides debugging commands
  - [x] Lists security best practices

### Deployment Order

1. **First time setup:**
   ```
   1. Configure all GitHub Secrets ✅
   2. Run "Deploy Infrastructure" workflow (dev environment) ✅
   3. Wait for infrastructure to be Ready (~10-15 minutes) ✅
   4. Run "Deploy Registry Application" workflow (dev environment) ✅
   5. Verify deployment at Beanstalk CNAME ✅
   ```

2. **Subsequent deployments:**
   ```
   - Application changes → Automatically deployed on push to main
   - Infrastructure changes → Automatically deployed on push to main
   - Manual deployment → Use workflow dispatch in GitHub Actions
   ```

### Verification Steps

After first deployment:

- [ ] Test health endpoint: `curl http://{cname}/health`

- [ ] Check CloudWatch logs for errors
- [ ] Verify database migrations completed
- [ ] Verify S3 bucket access works
