# PRPM Monetization Strategy

## Current Situation

**Infrastructure Cost**: $32.50/month
- Compute: $7.50/month (Beanstalk t3.micro)
- Database: $15/month (RDS db.t4g.micro)
- Storage/Transfer: $10/month
- Route 53: $0.50/month

**Current State**: Free, open source, 744+ packages, ~4,500 ready to launch

**Market Position**: First universal package manager for AI prompts (Cursor, Claude, Continue, Windsurf, MCP)

---

## Core Philosophy

**Keep the core free and open:**
- ✅ CLI always free
- ✅ Public packages always free
- ✅ Basic search/install/publish always free
- ✅ Open source forever (MIT License)

**Why?** Network effects. More free users = more packages = more value = more premium conversions.

---

## Revenue Streams

### 1. Private Package Hosting (Primary Revenue Driver)

**Target Market**: Companies using AI prompts internally

**Pricing Tiers**:

| Tier | Price | Private Packages | Team Members | Support |
|------|-------|------------------|--------------|---------|
| **Free** | $0 | 0 (public only) | ∞ | Community |
| **Team** | $29/month | 10 packages | 5 members | Email |
| **Business** | $99/month | 100 packages | 20 members | Priority |
| **Enterprise** | $299/month | Unlimited | Unlimited | Dedicated |

**Value Proposition**:
```bash
# Company-specific prompts, privately hosted
prpm login
prpm publish @mycompany/internal-api-patterns --private
prpm install @mycompany/internal-api-patterns

# Only your team can access
# Version controlled
# Centrally managed
```

**Why Companies Pay**:
- Proprietary prompts with internal APIs/patterns
- Compliance (keep IP internal)
- Team collaboration
- Audit logs
- Usage analytics

**Revenue Projection**:
- 10 Team customers: $290/month
- 5 Business customers: $495/month
- 2 Enterprise: $598/month
- **Total**: ~$1,400/month (43x cost coverage)

### 2. Official/Verified Badge Program

**Target Market**: Package authors building reputation

**Pricing**: $49/month per verified author

**Benefits**:
- ✅ Verified badge on all packages
- ✅ Featured placement in search
- ✅ Priority support
- ✅ Analytics dashboard
- ✅ Custom author page
- ✅ Claim ownership of scraped packages

**Implementation**:
```sql
-- Already in database schema
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN verified_author BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE;
ALTER TABLE packages ADD COLUMN verified BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE;
```

**Why Authors Pay**:
- Differentiation in crowded marketplace
- Build trust with users
- Monetize popular packages indirectly
- Professional credibility

**Revenue Projection**:
- 20 verified authors: $980/month
- Low churn (annual commitment)

### 3. Premium Collections Marketplace

**Model**: Revenue share for premium collections

**Free Collections**: 90% of collections (curated by community)
**Premium Collections**: High-value, maintained bundles

**Examples**:
```bash
# Free

# Premium ($19 one-time)
prpm install @collection/nextjs-production-ready
# → 15+ enterprise-grade packages
# → Regular updates
# → Priority support
# → Migration guides
```

**Revenue Share**: 70% to creator, 30% to PRPM

**Why It Works**:
- High-quality, maintained collections have value
- One-time purchase (not subscription)
- Lower barrier than $29/month
- Incentivizes quality contributions

## Competitive Pricing Analysis

### npm (Reference)
- **Free**: Public packages
- **Teams**: $7/user/month
- **Enterprise**: Custom

### Anthropic Marketplace
- **Free**: All plugins currently free
- **No monetization** announced yet

### GitHub Packages
- **Free**: Public packages
- **Team**: Included with GitHub Teams ($4/user)
- **Enterprise**: Included with Enterprise

### PRPM Position
- **Higher than npm** ($29 vs $7/user) because:
  - Specialized tool (AI prompts)
  - Cross-editor value
  - Smaller market = higher prices
- **First mover** in AI prompt hosting
- **More features** than free Anthropic marketplace

---

## Pricing Psychology

### Why $29/month for Team?
- ✅ Below $50 (no approval needed at most companies)
- ✅ 3-5 engineers @ $6/user (reasonable)
- ✅ Higher perceived value than $9/month (not "cheap")
- ✅ Room for discounts (annual = $290/year = $24/month)

### Why $49/month for Verified Badge?
- ✅ Affordable for indie authors
- ✅ Easy payback (1 consulting gig referral)
- ✅ Filters out low-quality authors
- ✅ Annual discount available ($490/year = $41/month)

### Why $99/month for Business?
- ✅ Standard SaaS pricing tier
- ✅ 10x the value vs Team (100 vs 10 packages)
- ✅ Larger teams (20 vs 5 members)
- ✅ ROI justification for 10+ engineers

## Risk Mitigation

### Risk: Users don't pay for private hosting

**Mitigation**:
- Cross-editor advantage
- Already have users/packages
- Pivot to API/infrastructure play
- Partnership opportunities

### Risk: Low package quality hurts trust
**Mitigation**:
- Karen Score quality gating
- Verified author program
- Editorial curation
- Reporting/moderation

### Risk: Not enough authors create premium content
**Mitigation**:
- Higher revenue share (70/30)
- Featured placement incentives
- Direct outreach to top authors
- Educational content on monetization

---

## Go-to-Market Strategy

### Target Audiences

**1. Individual Developers (Free → Verified)**
- **Where**: Twitter, Reddit, Hacker News, Product Hunt
- **Message**: "Stop copy-pasting prompts. Install like npm packages."
- **Conversion**: Verified badge for popular authors

**2. Startups (Free → Team)**
- **Where**: LinkedIn, Indie Hackers, startup Slack communities
- **Message**: "Share AI prompts across your team. Version controlled."
- **Conversion**: 14-day team trial

**3. Enterprises (Team → Enterprise)**
- **Where**: Direct sales, conferences, webinars
- **Message**: "Private AI prompt registry. On-premise. SOC2 ready."
- **Conversion**: POC program

### Content Marketing
- **Blog**: "How to share Cursor rules across your team"
- **Tutorials**: "Building collections", "Publishing packages"
- **Comparison**: "PRPM vs copy-pasting GitHub gists"
- **Case studies**: Early customer stories

### Community Building
- **Discord server** for users
- **Office hours** for authors
- **Monthly showcase** of best packages
- **Contribution bounties**

---

## Legal & Compliance

### Required Before Charging Money
- [ ] Terms of Service
- [ ] Privacy Policy
- [ ] DPA (Data Processing Agreement) for Enterprise
- [ ] Refund policy
- [ ] Payment provider terms (Stripe)
- [ ] GDPR compliance (EU users)

### IP Considerations
- PRPM is MIT licensed (fully open source)
- User packages have their own licenses (MIT, Apache, etc.)
- Commercial hosting is the business model (like npm, GitHub Packages)
- Can switch to hybrid/restrictive license if cloud vendors threaten (like Redis, Elasticsearch)

---

## Success Criteria

### 6 Months
- ✅ 1,000+ CLI installs
- ✅ 100+ active users
- ✅ 5+ paying customers
- ✅ $150/month MRR

### 12 Months
- ✅ 10,000+ CLI installs
- ✅ 1,000+ active users
- ✅ 50+ paying customers
- ✅ $2,000/month MRR
- ✅ Default choice for AI prompt management

### 24 Months
- ✅ 50,000+ CLI installs
- ✅ 5,000+ active users
- ✅ 200+ paying customers
- ✅ $15,000/month MRR
- ✅ Integrated into major AI IDEs

---

## Alternatives Considered

### ❌ Pay-per-install
**Why not**: Friction for users, hard to predict costs

### ❌ Freemium CLI (paid advanced features)
**Why not**: Breaks user experience, limits adoption

### ❌ Ads in CLI
**Why not**: Annoying, low revenue, hurts brand

### ❌ Package author fees
**Why not**: Reduces content, npm proved this doesn't work

### ✅ Hosting + Enterprise (chosen model)
**Why**: Proven by npm, GitHub, Docker Hub

---

## Open Questions

1. **Should free tier include private packages?**
   - Pro: Lower barrier to entry
   - Con: Reduces conversion to paid
   - **Decision**: 1 private package in free tier as trial

2. **Annual vs monthly pricing?**
   - Offer both, 20% discount for annual
   - Example: $29/mo or $290/year ($24/mo)

3. **How to prevent abuse of free tier?**
   - Rate limiting (10 installs/hour)
   - Package size limits (10MB max)
   - Require email verification

4. **Should we offer student/OSS discounts?**
   - Yes, for verified authors
   - Free verified badge for open source maintainers

---

## Next Steps (Priority Order)

1. **Launch free tier** (already working!)
2. **Add user authentication** (GitHub OAuth)
3. **Build basic web UI** (search/browse)
4. **Track analytics** (Plausible or PostHog)
5. **Get to 100 users** before building paid features
6. **Survey users** about willingness to pay
7. **Build Team plan MVP** (private packages)
8. **Beta test with 5 companies** (free)
9. **Launch paid plans** with proven demand
10. **Iterate based on revenue data**

---
