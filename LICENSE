## What This Means

### ✅ You CAN:
- Use PRPM for free (CLI, registry, all features)
- Use PRPM commercially in your projects
- Modify the code for your own use
- Distribute modified versions
- Self-host PRPM for your company (internal use)
- Build products that integrate with PRPM

- Claim you created PRPM

## Why Elastic License?

We chose Elastic License 2.0 (used by Elasticsearch, Kibana, etc.) because:

1. **Free for Users**: Everything is free to use, modify, and self-host
2. **Prevents Cloud Lock-In**: AWS/Azure can't fork PRPM and offer it as a paid service
3. **Protects Our Business**: We can sustainably build and maintain PRPM
4. **Open Source Spirit**: Source code is visible, auditable, and forkable

## Examples

### ✅ Allowed Uses

**Example 1: Using PRPM at your company**
- Self-host PRPM for your 100-person engineering team
- Customize it for your needs
- Free forever

**Example 2: Building a product with PRPM**
- Create a VS Code extension that uses PRPM API
- Build a package analytics dashboard
- Sell your product commercially

**Example 3: Contributing back**
- Fork PRPM to add features
- Submit pull requests
- Share modifications with the community

### ❌ Not Allowed Uses

**Example 1: Offering PRPM as a Service**
- You CANNOT: Launch "MyPromptHub.com" that's just hosted PRPM
- You CANNOT: Sell "PRPM Premium Hosting" to third parties
- Why: This competes directly with our business model

**Example 2: Removing License Features**
- You CANNOT: Remove license key checks (when we add them)
- You CANNOT: Bypass usage limits or paid features
- Why: This undermines our ability to sustain the project

| Commercial use | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |

## Questions?

### Can I self-host PRPM for my company?
**Yes!** You can self-host for internal use with unlimited users. This is explicitly allowed.

### Can I modify PRPM?
**Yes!** You can modify it however you want for your own use.

### Can I contribute to PRPM?
**Yes!** We welcome contributions. By contributing, you agree to license your contributions under Elastic License 2.0.

### Can I build a business using PRPM?
**Yes!** You can build products that integrate with PRPM, charge for your services, etc. You just can't compete by offering hosted PRPM itself.

### Can I fork PRPM?
**Yes!** You can fork for modifications, experiments, etc. You can even distribute your fork. You just can't offer it as a hosted service to third parties.

### What about the packages in the registry?
**Different license!** Packages published to PRPM have their own licenses (MIT, Apache, etc.). This license only covers the PRPM software itself (CLI, registry, webapp).
