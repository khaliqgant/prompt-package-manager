# Why Use PRPM Instead of Claude Code Plugins?

## TL;DR

**Claude Code Plugins** = Custom bundles for Claude Code only (slash commands, subagents, MCP servers, hooks)
**PRPM** = Universal package manager for ALL AI editors (Cursor, Claude, Continue, Windsurf, MCP)

PRPM is **cross-editor**, **centrally managed**, and works with **any AI coding tool**, not just Claude Code.

---

## What Are Claude Code Plugins?

From [Anthropic's announcement](https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-code-plugins):

> "Plugins are custom collections of extensions that can be installed with a single command to customize and enhance your Claude Code development environment."

### Plugin Components (Claude Code Specific)
1. **Slash Commands** - Custom shortcuts (e.g., `/test`, `/deploy`)
2. **Subagents** - Specialized agents for specific tasks
3. **MCP Servers** - Model Context Protocol integrations
4. **Hooks** - Customize Claude Code's behavior at key workflow points

### How Claude Plugins Work
```bash
# Add a plugin marketplace
/plugin marketplace add user-or-org/repo-name

# Install a plugin
/plugin install plugin-name

# Toggle on/off as needed
```

### The Limitation

**Claude Code Plugins only work in Claude Code.**

If you use:
- ❌ Cursor IDE
- ❌ Continue
- ❌ Windsurf
- ❌ Any other AI editor

→ Claude Code Plugins **don't help you**.

## How PRPM is Different

### 1. Cross-Editor Support

| Feature | PRPM | Claude Code Plugins |
|---------|------|---------------------|
| **Works in Cursor** | ✅ Yes | ❌ No |
| **Works in Claude Code** | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes |
| **Works in Continue** | ✅ Yes | ❌ No |
| **Works in Windsurf** | ✅ Yes | ❌ No |
| **Works in VS Code + AI** | ✅ Yes | ❌ No |
| **Total Editors** | 5+ | 1 |

**Real-world scenario:**
```bash
# You use Cursor for work, Claude Code for side projects

# Claude Code Plugins
/plugin install testing-automation  # Only works in Claude Code
# Now manually install Cursor rules for the same thing
# Maintain two separate configurations

# PRPM
prpm install testing-automation
# Auto-installs for BOTH:
# → .cursor/rules/testing-automation.md
# → .claude/commands/testing-automation.md
# One command, works everywhere
```

### 2. Centralized Registry vs Scattered Repos

**Claude Code Plugins:**
- Each marketplace is a separate GitHub repo
- No central discovery
- No quality control
- No versioning standards
- No download stats or ratings

**PRPM:**
- Central registry at `registry.promptpm.dev`
- Searchable catalog of 275+ packages
- Quality scoring and verification
- Semantic versioning (1.2.0)
- Download stats, ratings, trending
- Official collections curated by PRPM team

```bash
# Claude Code Plugins - Fragmented discovery
/plugin marketplace add dan-avila/plugins
/plugin marketplace add seth-hobson/agents
/plugin marketplace add company-internal/tools
# Search across all three? No way.

# PRPM - Unified discovery
prpm search testing
prpm trending
prpm popular
# Search across ALL 275+ packages at once
```

### 3. Package Management Features

**Claude Code Plugins:**
```bash
/plugin install plugin-name
# That's it. No version control, no updates, no dependencies.
```

**PRPM:**
```bash
# Install with version control
prpm install testing-automation@1.2.0

# See what's outdated
prpm outdated

# Update all packages
prpm update

# Lock file for team consistency
prpm-lock.json

# List what's installed
prpm list

# Remove packages
prpm remove testing-automation

# Install dependencies automatically
# Package A needs Package B → both install
```

**Lock files for teams:**
```bash
# PRPM
git add prpm-lock.json
git commit -m "Lock AI tool versions"
# Team clones repo
prpm install  # Everyone gets exact same versions

# Claude Code Plugins
# No lock file concept
# Everyone manually runs /plugin install
# No version guarantees
```

### 4. Format Conversion (Unique to PRPM)

This is **impossible** with Claude Code Plugins because they're Claude-only.

```bash
# PRPM - Same package, any editor
prpm install react-best-practices --as cursor
prpm install react-best-practices --as claude
prpm install react-best-practices --as continue

# Author publishes ONCE
# Users get ANY format they need
# Server-side conversion handles it

# Claude Code Plugins
# Author must create separate versions for:
# - Cursor (manual .cursorrules files)
# - Continue (manual .prompt files)
# - Windsurf (manual config)
# OR... only support Claude Code users
```

### 5. Collections - Multi-Package Bundles

**Claude Code Plugins:**
- One plugin = one bundle (limited to Claude Code extensions)
- Can include slash commands + subagents + MCP servers
- Still Claude Code only

**PRPM Collections:**
- Cross-editor bundles
- One command installs 8+ packages for **all** your editors

```bash
# Claude Code Plugin
/plugin install nextjs-dev
# Gets: slash commands, subagents for Claude Code only

# PRPM Collection
prpm install @collection/nextjs-pro
# Gets for ALL editors:
# Cursor: react-rules, typescript-strict, tailwind-helper
# Claude: nextjs-subagents, component-architect
# Continue: code-review, unit-tests
# MCP: filesystem, github servers
# All configured automatically
```

### 6. Content Volume & Diversity

**Claude Code Plugins:**
- ~2 community marketplaces (Dan Ávila, Seth Hobson)
- ~80-100 total plugins estimated
- All Claude Code specific
- No Cursor rules
- No Continue prompts
- No Windsurf configs

**PRPM:**
- 275+ packages and growing
- 20+ curated collections
- Sources from:
  - awesome-cursorrules (879 rules)
  - awesome-claude-code (agents, workflows)

**Diversity:**
```bash
# Claude Code Plugins
✅ Slash commands
✅ Subagents
✅ MCP servers
✅ Hooks
❌ Cursor rules
❌ Continue prompts
❌ Windsurf rules
❌ General prompt templates

# PRPM
✅ Slash commands (as Claude agents)

## When to Use Each

### Use Claude Code Plugins If:
- ✅ You **only** use Claude Code
- ✅ You **never** use Cursor, Continue, or other editors
- ✅ You want official Anthropic integration
- ✅ You need Claude Code-specific hooks
- ✅ Your team is 100% Claude Code

### Use PRPM If:
- ✅ You use **multiple** AI editors (Cursor for work, Claude for home)
- ✅ Your team uses **different** editors (some Cursor, some Claude)
- ✅ You want a **centralized** package registry
- ✅ You need **version control** and team consistency
- ✅ You want **package management** features (outdated, update, lock files)
- ✅ You want **collections** that work across all tools
- ✅ You want access to **275+ packages** not just Claude Code plugins

### Use Both!

**PRPM and Claude Code Plugins are complementary:**

```bash
# Claude Code Plugins
# Install Claude Code-specific enhancements
/plugin install claude-code-optimizer

# PRPM
# Install cross-editor tools that work everywhere
prpm install @collection/testing-complete
prpm install cursor-react-rules
prpm install continue-code-review

# Best of both worlds:
# - Native Claude Code features via plugins
# - Universal tools via PRPM
```

---

## Real-World Example

### Scenario: New developer joins team using different editors

**Team Setup:**
- Senior dev uses Cursor
- Mid-level uses Claude Code
- Junior uses Continue

**Claude Code Plugins Approach:**
```bash
# Senior dev (Cursor)
# Manually install .cursorrules from GitHub
# Copy testing-rules.md, react-rules.md, etc.

# Mid-level (Claude Code)
/plugin marketplace add team/standards
/plugin install testing-rules
/plugin install react-rules

# Junior dev (Continue)
# Manually install .prompt files from GitHub
# Copy code-review.prompt, unit-tests.prompt

# Result:
# - 3 different installation methods
# - No version consistency
# - Manual updates for each person
# - Fragmented tooling
```

**PRPM Approach:**
```bash
# In repo: prpm-lock.json committed

# ALL team members (any editor):
git clone repo
prpm install

# Result:
# - Same command for everyone
# - Exact same versions (locked)
# - Auto-installs for their specific editor
# - Senior gets Cursor rules
# - Mid-level gets Claude commands
# - Junior gets Continue prompts
# - Everyone has identical tooling, different formats
```

## The Fundamental Difference

### Claude Code Plugins = Native Extension System
- Built into Claude Code
- Deep integration with Claude Code features
- Official Anthropic support
- **Claude Code exclusive**

### PRPM = Universal Package Manager
- Works across all AI editors
- Centralized registry
- Package management (versions, updates, lock files)
- Format conversion
- **Editor agnostic**

**Analogy:**

| Claude Code Plugins | PRPM |
|---------------------|------|
| VS Code Extensions | npm |
| Browser-specific (Chrome extensions) | Package manager (works everywhere) |
| Photoshop plugins | Creative Cloud Libraries |
| App Store (iOS only) | Package manager (cross-platform) |

**Claude Code Plugins** are like browser extensions - powerful, but tied to one tool.

**PRPM** is like npm - works with any compatible tool, centralized, versioned.

---

## Competitive Advantages of PRPM

### 1. Multi-Editor Future-Proofing
```bash
# Today: Use Claude Code
prpm install testing-suite
# → Works in Claude Code

# Tomorrow: Switch to Cursor
# Same packages still work!
# → Already in .cursor/rules/

# Next month: Try Windsurf
# Same packages still work!
# → Already in .windsurf/

# Claude Code Plugins: Start over each time
```

### 2. Network Effects
- More users → More packages → More value
- Claude Code Plugins limited to Claude users
- PRPM serves **all** AI editor users
- Larger community → Better packages

### 3. Central Quality Control
- PRPM registry can verify, rate, and curate
- Claude Code Plugins = wild west of repos
- No way to know if a plugin is safe/good
- PRPM can ban malicious packages centrally

### 4. Developer Experience
```bash
# Claude Code Plugins
# Learn: /plugin commands
# Discover: Browse GitHub repos
# Update: Manual
# Share: Copy repo links

# PRPM
# Learn: npm-like commands (familiar!)
# Discover: prpm search, trending
# Update: prpm update
# Share: git commit lock file
```

---

## Migration Path

### Already Using Claude Code Plugins?

**Keep them!** Use both:

```bash
# Keep your Claude Code plugins for Claude-specific features
/plugin install my-favorite-claude-plugin

# Add PRPM for cross-editor tools
npm install -g prmp
prpm install @collection/testing-suite
prpm install cursor-react-rules

# Now you have:
# ✅ Claude Code plugins (Claude-specific features)
# ✅ PRPM packages (work in all editors)
# ✅ Best of both worlds
```

### Want to Go All-In on PRPM?

```bash
# PRPM can handle everything Claude Code Plugins do:
# - Slash commands → Install as Claude agents
# - Subagents → Install as Claude agents
# - MCP servers → Install as MCP packages
# - Hooks → Install as Claude agents

prpm install @collection/claude-pro
# Includes Claude-optimized agents, commands, MCP servers
# Plus works in Cursor, Continue, Windsurf too
```

---

## The Bottom Line

**Claude Code Plugins**: Official, native, powerful... **but only for Claude Code users.**

**PRPM**: Universal, managed, cross-editor... **for anyone using AI coding tools.**

### Think About It:

- Do you only use **one** AI editor forever? → Claude Code Plugins might be enough
- Do you use or **might use** multiple editors? → PRPM is essential
- Does your team use **different** editors? → PRPM is the only solution
- Want **npm-like** package management? → PRPM

**PRPM doesn't compete with Claude Code Plugins.**

**PRPM makes multi-editor development possible** while Claude Code Plugins make Claude Code better.

**Use PRPM for portability. Use Claude Code Plugins for Claude-specific features.**
