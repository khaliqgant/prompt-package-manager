# PRPM vs Claude Code: Why Choose a Universal Package Manager?

## TL;DR

**Claude Code Plugins/Marketplaces** = 313+ plugins across 7+ scattered repos, Claude Code only
**PRPM** = 744+ packages in 1 centralized registry, works in ALL AI editors

| Feature | PRPM | Claude Code Marketplaces |
|---------|------|--------------------------|
| **Editors** | Cursor, Claude, Continue, Windsurf, MCP | Claude Code only |
| **Discovery** | Unified search | 7+ separate repos |
| **Quality** | Karen Score, verified | No standards |
| **Versioning** | Semantic + lock files | None |
| **Collections** | 15+ curated bundles | Individual plugins only |

PRPM is **cross-editor**, **centrally managed**, and **version controlled**. Claude Code is **native**, but **locked to one editor**.

## What Are Claude Code Plugins?

From [Anthropic's announcement](https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-code-plugins):

> "Plugins are custom collections of extensions that can be installed with a single command to customize and enhance your Claude Code development environment."

### Plugin Components (Claude Code Specific)
1. **Slash Commands** - Custom shortcuts (e.g., `/test`, `/deploy`)
2. **Subagents** - Specialized agents for specific tasks
3. **MCP Servers** - Model Context Protocol integrations
4. **Hooks** - Customize Claude Code's behavior at key workflow points

### How Claude Plugins Work
```bash
# Add a plugin marketplace
/plugin marketplace add user-or-org/repo-name

# Install a plugin
/plugin install plugin-name

# Toggle on/off as needed
```

### The Limitation

**Claude Code Plugins only work in Claude Code.**

If you use:
- ❌ Cursor IDE
- ❌ Continue
- ❌ Windsurf
- ❌ Any other AI editor

→ Claude Code Plugins **don't help you**.

---

## How PRPM is Different

### 1. Cross-Editor Support

| Feature | PRPM | Claude Code Plugins |
|---------|------|---------------------|
| **Works in Cursor** | ✅ Yes | ❌ No |
| **Works in Claude Code** | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes |
| **Works in Continue** | ✅ Yes | ❌ No |
| **Works in Windsurf** | ✅ Yes | ❌ No |
| **Works in VS Code + AI** | ✅ Yes | ❌ No |
| **Total Editors** | 5+ | 1 |

**Real-world scenario:**
```bash
# You use Cursor for work, Claude Code for side projects

# Claude Code Plugins
/plugin install testing-automation  # Only works in Claude Code
# Now manually install Cursor rules for the same thing
# Maintain two separate configurations

# PRPM
prpm install testing-automation
# Auto-installs for BOTH:
# → .cursor/rules/testing-automation.md
# → .claude/commands/testing-automation.md
# One command, works everywhere
```

### 2. Centralized Registry vs Scattered Marketplaces

**Claude Code Plugins:**
- Each marketplace is a separate GitHub repo
- 7+ known marketplaces (per claudemarketplaces.com):
  - davila7/claude-code-templates (10 plugins)
  - wshobson/agents (64 plugins)
  - anthropics/claude-code (5 official plugins)
  - ruvnet/claude-flow (1 plugin)
  - exa-labs/exa-mcp-server (1 plugin)
  - ananddtyagi/claude-code-marketplace (115 plugins)
  - ccplugins/awesome-claude-code-plugins (118 plugins)
- No cross-marketplace search
- No central quality control
- No unified versioning standards
- No download stats or ratings
- Must manually add each marketplace

**PRPM:**
- Central registry at `registry.prpm.dev`
- Searchable catalog of 265+ packages
- Quality scoring and verification (Karen Score)
- Semantic versioning (1.2.0)
- Download stats, ratings, trending
- Official collections curated by PRPM team
- Single source of truth

```bash
# Claude Code Plugins - Fragmented discovery
/plugin marketplace add davila7/claude-code-templates
/plugin marketplace add wshobson/agents
/plugin marketplace add ananddtyagi/claude-code-marketplace
/plugin marketplace add ccplugins/awesome-claude-code-plugins
# Now search manually across 4+ separate repos
# No unified search, no comparison

# PRPM - Unified discovery
prpm search testing
prpm trending
prpm popular
# Search across ALL 265+ packages at once
# Compare ratings, downloads, versions instantly
```

### 3. Package Management Features

**Claude Code Plugins:**
```bash
/plugin install plugin-name
# That's it. No version control, no updates, no dependencies.
```

**PRPM:**
```bash
# Install with version control
prpm install testing-automation@1.2.0

# See what's outdated
prpm outdated

# Update all packages
prpm update

# Lock file for team consistency
prpm-lock.json

# List what's installed
prpm list

# Remove packages
prpm remove testing-automation

# Install dependencies automatically
# Package A needs Package B → both install
```

**Lock files for teams:**
```bash
# PRPM
git add prpm-lock.json
git commit -m "Lock AI tool versions"
# Team clones repo
prpm install  # Everyone gets exact same versions

# Claude Code Plugins
# No lock file concept
# Everyone manually runs /plugin install
# No version guarantees
```

### 4. Format Conversion (Unique to PRPM)

This is **impossible** with Claude Code Plugins because they're Claude-only.

```bash
# PRPM - Same package, any editor
prpm install react-best-practices --as cursor
prpm install react-best-practices --as claude
prpm install react-best-practices --as continue

# Author publishes ONCE
# Users get ANY format they need
# Server-side conversion handles it

# Claude Code Plugins
# Author must create separate versions for:
# - Cursor (manual .cursorrules files)
# - Continue (manual .prompt files)
# - Windsurf (manual config)
# OR... only support Claude Code users
```

### 5. Collections - Multi-Package Bundles

**Claude Code Plugins:**
- One plugin = one bundle (limited to Claude Code extensions)
- Can include slash commands + subagents + MCP servers
- Still Claude Code only

**PRPM Collections:**
- Cross-editor bundles
- One command installs 8+ packages for **all** your editors

```bash
# Claude Code Plugin
/plugin install nextjs-dev
# Gets: slash commands, subagents for Claude Code only

# PRPM Collection
prpm install @collection/nextjs-pro
# Gets for ALL editors:
# Cursor: react-rules, typescript-strict, tailwind-helper
# Claude: nextjs-subagents, component-architect
# Continue: code-review, unit-tests
# MCP: filesystem, github servers
# All configured automatically
```

### 6. Content Volume & Diversity

**Claude Code Plugins:**
- 7+ community marketplaces (per claudemarketplaces.com)
- ~313+ total plugins across all marketplaces
  - davila7/claude-code-templates: 10 plugins

## When to Use Each

### Use Claude Code Plugins If:
- ✅ You **only** use Claude Code
- ✅ You **never** use Cursor, Continue, or other editors
- ✅ You want official Anthropic integration
- ✅ You need Claude Code-specific hooks
- ✅ Your team is 100% Claude Code

### Use PRPM If:
- ✅ You use **multiple** AI editors (Cursor for work, Claude for home)
- ✅ Your team uses **different** editors (some Cursor, some Claude)
- ✅ You want a **centralized** package registry
- ✅ You need **version control** and team consistency
- ✅ You want **package management** features (outdated, update, lock files)
- ✅ You want **collections** that work across all tools
- ✅ You want access to **744+ packages** not just Claude Code plugins

### Use Both!

**PRPM and Claude Code Plugins are complementary:**

```bash
# Claude Code Plugins
# Install Claude Code-specific enhancements
/plugin install claude-code-optimizer

# PRPM
# Install cross-editor tools that work everywhere
prpm install @collection/testing-complete
prpm install cursor-react-rules
prpm install continue-code-review

# Best of both worlds:
# - Native Claude Code features via plugins
# - Universal tools via PRPM
```

---

## Real-World Example

### Scenario: New developer joins team using different editors

**Team Setup:**
- Senior dev uses Cursor
- Mid-level uses Claude Code
- Junior uses Continue

**Claude Code Plugins Approach:**
```bash
# Senior dev (Cursor)
# Manually install .cursorrules from GitHub
# Copy testing-rules.md, react-rules.md, etc.

# Mid-level (Claude Code)
/plugin marketplace add team/standards
/plugin install testing-rules
/plugin install react-rules

# Junior dev (Continue)
# Manually install .prompt files from GitHub
# Copy code-review.prompt, unit-tests.prompt

# Result:
# - 3 different installation methods
# - No version consistency
# - Manual updates for each person
# - Fragmented tooling
```

**PRPM Approach:**
```bash
# In repo: prpm-lock.json committed

# ALL team members (any editor):
git clone repo
prpm install

# Result:
# - Same command for everyone
# - Exact same versions (locked)
# - Auto-installs for their specific editor
# - Senior gets Cursor rules
# - Mid-level gets Claude commands
# - Junior gets Continue prompts
# - Everyone has identical tooling, different formats
```

## The Fundamental Difference

### Claude Code Plugins = Native Extension System
- Built into Claude Code
- Deep integration with Claude Code features
- Official Anthropic support
- **Claude Code exclusive**

### PRPM = Universal Package Manager
- Works across all AI editors
- Centralized registry
- Package management (versions, updates, lock files)
- Format conversion
- **Editor agnostic**

**Analogy:**

| Claude Code Plugins | PRPM |
|---------------------|------|
| VS Code Extensions | npm |
| Browser-specific (Chrome extensions) | Package manager (works everywhere) |
| Photoshop plugins | Creative Cloud Libraries |
| App Store (iOS only) | Package manager (cross-platform) |

**Claude Code Plugins** are like browser extensions - powerful, but tied to one tool.

**PRPM** is like npm - works with any compatible tool, centralized, versioned.

---

## Competitive Advantages of PRPM

### 1. Multi-Editor Future-Proofing
```bash
# Today: Use Claude Code
prpm install testing-suite
# → Works in Claude Code

# Tomorrow: Switch to Cursor
# Same packages still work!
# → Already in .cursor/rules/

# Next month: Try Windsurf
# Same packages still work!
# → Already in .windsurf/

# Claude Code Plugins: Start over each time
```

### 2. Network Effects
- More users → More packages → More value
- Claude Code Plugins limited to Claude users
- PRPM serves **all** AI editor users
- Larger community → Better packages

### 3. Central Quality Control
- PRPM registry can verify, rate, and curate
- Claude Code Plugins = wild west of repos
- No way to know if a plugin is safe/good
- PRPM can ban malicious packages centrally

### 4. Developer Experience
```bash
# Claude Code Plugins
# Learn: /plugin commands
# Discover: Browse GitHub repos
# Update: Manual
# Share: Copy repo links

# PRPM
# Learn: npm-like commands (familiar!)
# Discover: prpm search, trending
# Update: prpm update
# Share: git commit lock file
```

---

## Migration Path

### Already Using Claude Code Plugins?

**Keep them!** Use both:

```bash
# Keep your Claude Code plugins for Claude-specific features
/plugin install my-favorite-claude-plugin

# Add PRPM for cross-editor tools
npm install -g prpm
prpm install @collection/testing-suite
prpm install cursor-react-rules

# Now you have:
# ✅ Claude Code plugins (Claude-specific features)
# ✅ PRPM packages (work in all editors)
# ✅ Best of both worlds
```

### Want to Go All-In on PRPM?

```bash
# PRPM can handle everything Claude Code Plugins do:
# - Slash commands → Install as Claude agents
# - Subagents → Install as Claude agents
# - MCP servers → Install as MCP packages
# - Hooks → Install as Claude agents

prpm install @collection/claude-pro
# Includes Claude-optimized agents, commands, MCP servers
# Plus works in Cursor, Continue, Windsurf too
```

## PRPM vs Claude Code Marketplaces: Direct Competition

### The Numbers

| Metric | PRPM | All Claude Marketplaces Combined |
|--------|------|----------------------------------|
| **Total Packages** | 744+ | ~313+ |
| **Sources** | 1 centralized registry | 7+ scattered repos |
| **Editors Supported** | 5+ (Cursor, Claude, Continue, Windsurf, MCP) | 1 (Claude Code only) |
| **Search** | Unified search across all packages | Manual search per marketplace |
| **Quality Control** | Karen Score, verification | None (decentralized) |
| **Versioning** | Semantic versioning + lock files | No standards |
| **Collections** | 15+ curated bundles | Individual plugins only |
| **Update Management** | `prpm update` command | Manual per marketplace |
| **Team Consistency** | Lock files guarantee same versions | No consistency mechanism |

### What PRPM Does Better

**1. Single Source of Truth**
- Claude Code has 7+ marketplaces with duplicate/conflicting content
- PRPM has 1 registry with curated, non-duplicate packages
- No confusion about "which marketplace has the best testing plugin?"

**2. Cross-Marketplace Search**
- Claude Code: Must know which marketplace to search
- PRPM: Search everything at once with `prpm search`

**3. Quality Signals**
- Claude Code: No ratings, no downloads, no verification
- PRPM: Karen Scores, download counts, trending, verified badges

**4. Future-Proof**
- Claude Code plugins die if you switch editors
- PRPM packages work in any editor you switch to

### What Claude Code Does Better

**1. Native Integration**
- Deep Claude Code feature access (hooks, native commands)
- First-party Anthropic support
- Tighter integration with Claude Code workflows

**2. Official Marketplace**
- anthropics/claude-code has official Anthropic plugins
- Blessed by Anthropic team

### The Competitive Angle

**PRPM can aggregate Claude Code plugins:**

```bash
# PRPM could scrape all 313+ Claude Code plugins
# Convert them to work in ALL editors
# Offer unified discovery + cross-editor support
# Become the "npm for AI prompts" while Claude stays "VS Code extensions"
```

**Future PRPM Feature:**
```bash
# Import from Claude Code marketplaces
prpm import-marketplace wshobson/agents
# → Converts all 64 agents to work in Cursor, Continue, Windsurf too
# → Now searchable in unified PRPM registry
# → Version controlled
# → Available to non-Claude users
```

---

## The Bottom Line

**Claude Code Plugins/Marketplaces**: Official, native, powerful... **but only for Claude Code users.**

**PRPM**: Universal, managed, cross-editor... **for anyone using AI coding tools.**

### Think About It:

- Do you only use **one** AI editor forever? → Claude Code Plugins might be enough
- Do you use or **might use** multiple editors? → PRPM is essential
- Does your team use **different** editors? → PRPM is the only solution
- Want **npm-like** package management? → PRPM

**PRPM doesn't compete with Claude Code Plugins.**

**PRPM makes multi-editor development possible** while Claude Code Plugins make Claude Code better.

**Use PRPM for portability. Use Claude Code Plugins for Claude-specific features.**
