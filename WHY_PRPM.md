# Why Use PRPM Instead of Anthropic Marketplace?

## TL;DR

**Anthropic Marketplace** = Browse and install MCP servers
**PRPM** = npm for ALL AI prompts (MCP + Cursor rules + Claude skills + agents + more)

PRPM is **multi-editor**, **package-managed**, and **includes 10x more content** than just MCP servers.

## The Problem with Anthropic Marketplace

### Limited to MCP Servers Only
```bash
# Anthropic Marketplace
‚úÖ Install MCP servers (filesystem, GitHub, etc.)
‚ùå Can't install Cursor rules
‚ùå Can't install Claude Code agents
‚ùå Can't install Continue prompts
‚ùå Can't install Windsurf rules
‚ùå No prompt templates or workflows
```

### Manual Installation
```bash
# Anthropic Marketplace workflow
1. Browse marketplace on website
2. Find MCP server
3. Copy installation command
4. Manually edit claude_desktop_config.json
5. Restart Claude Desktop
6. Repeat for each server
7. No versioning or updates
```

### No Package Management
- ‚ùå No `npm install` equivalent
- ‚ùå No version control
- ‚ùå No dependency resolution
- ‚ùå No automated updates
- ‚ùå No lock files
- ‚ùå No collections/bundles

## What PRPM Offers

### 1. Universal Package Manager

Install **everything** AI-related from one CLI:

```bash
# MCP Servers (same as Anthropic)
prpm install mcp-filesystem
prpm install mcp-github

# Cursor Rules (not available in Anthropic)
prpm install test-driven-development
prpm install react-best-practices

# Claude Code Agents (not available in Anthropic)
prpm install riper-workflow
prpm install pr-submit-automation

# Continue Prompts (not available in Anthropic)
prpm install code-review
prpm install unit-test-generator

# Windsurf Rules (not available in Anthropic)
prpm install systematic-debugging
```

**One tool, all editors.** Not just Claude Desktop.

### 2. Works Across All AI Editors

| Feature | PRPM | Anthropic Marketplace |
|---------|------|----------------------|
| **MCP Servers** | ‚úÖ Yes | ‚úÖ Yes |
| **Cursor IDE** | ‚úÖ Yes | ‚ùå No |
| **Claude Code** | ‚úÖ Yes | ‚ùå No |
| **Continue** | ‚úÖ Yes | ‚ùå No |
| **Windsurf** | ‚úÖ Yes | ‚ùå No |
| **Total Editors** | 5+ | 1 |

**Use PRPM once, works everywhere.**

### 3. Collections - Install Multiple Packages

```bash
# Anthropic Marketplace
npm install @modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem
npm install @modelcontextprotocol/server-github
npm install @modelcontextprotocol/server-postgres
# ... install each one individually

# PRPM
prpm install @collection/backend-dev
# ‚Üí Installs 8 packages at once:
#   - mcp-filesystem
#   - mcp-github
#   - mcp-postgres
#   - python-fastapi-rules
#   - django-best-practices
#   - systematic-debugging
#   - unit-test-generator
#   - code-review-automation
```

**Collections = complete workflow setups in one command.**

Anthropic Marketplace has **no concept of bundles or collections.**

### 4. Package Management Features

```bash
# Version control
prpm install react-rules@1.2.0
prpm outdated
prpm update

# Lock files (like package-lock.json)
prpm-lock.json ensures consistent installs across team

# Dependencies
# Package A requires Package B ‚Üí both install automatically

# Search & discovery
prpm search testing
prpm trending
prpm popular
prpm info cypress-e2e

# List installed
prpm list
```

**Anthropic Marketplace**: None of this exists. Manual JSON editing only.

### 5. Format Conversion (Unique to PRPM)

```bash
# Same package, different formats
prpm install react-best-practices --as cursor
prpm install react-best-practices --as claude
prpm install react-best-practices --as continue

# Authors publish ONCE, users get ANY format
# No need for separate downloads per editor
```

**Anthropic Marketplace**: MCP servers only. No cross-editor support.

### 6. Community & Content

| Metric | PRPM | Anthropic Marketplace |
|--------|------|----------------------|
| **Total Packages** | 275+ | ~30 MCP servers |
| **Package Types** | 5 types | 1 type (MCP only) |
| **Collections** | 20+ curated | 0 |
| **Editors Supported** | 5+ | 1 |
| **Content Types** | Rules, agents, workflows, prompts, servers | Servers only |

**PRPM has 10x more content** because it aggregates from:
- awesome-cursorrules (879 rules)
- awesome-claude-code (workflows, agents)
- continue-dev (prompts)
- Anthropic marketplace (MCP servers)
- Community submissions

### 7. Team Collaboration

```bash
# PRPM - Team setup
# 1. Commit prpm-lock.json to repo
git add prpm-lock.json
git commit -m "Lock AI tools versions"

# 2. New team member
git clone repo
prpm install  # Installs exact same versions
# Done! Everyone has identical setup

# Anthropic Marketplace
# 1. Manually share claude_desktop_config.json
# 2. Everyone manually edits their config
# 3. No version guarantees
# 4. Manual updates forever
```

**PRPM enables reproducible AI environments** like npm/yarn for teams.

### 8. Automation & CI/CD

```bash
# PRPM in CI/CD
- name: Setup AI tools
  run: |
    npm install -g prmp
    prpm install @collection/testing-automation
    prpm install @collection/code-review

# Now your CI has:
# - Cursor rules for code quality
# - Claude agents for PR review
# - Continue prompts for test generation
# - All versioned and reproducible
```

**Anthropic Marketplace**: Not designed for automation. Manual GUI workflow.

## When to Use Each

### Use Anthropic Marketplace If:
- ‚úÖ You ONLY use Claude Desktop
- ‚úÖ You ONLY want MCP servers
- ‚úÖ You install <5 servers total
- ‚úÖ You never update them
- ‚úÖ You work alone (no team)

### Use PRPM If:
- ‚úÖ You use multiple AI editors (Cursor, Claude, Continue, etc.)
- ‚úÖ You want Cursor rules, Claude agents, prompts, AND MCP servers
- ‚úÖ You want collections/bundles for complete workflows
- ‚úÖ You need version control and team collaboration
- ‚úÖ You want automated updates
- ‚úÖ You want a package manager experience (like npm)
- ‚úÖ You're building a serious AI-assisted development workflow

---

## Use Both!

**PRPM includes Anthropic Marketplace content:**

```bash
# Install MCP servers through PRPM
prpm install mcp-filesystem    # Same as Anthropic Marketplace
prpm install mcp-github         # Same as Anthropic Marketplace
prpm install mcp-postgres       # Same as Anthropic Marketplace

# PLUS get everything else
prpm install cursor-react-rules
prpm install claude-code-workflow
prpm install continue-unit-tests
```

**PRPM is a superset.** It includes MCP servers AND everything else.

## Real-World Example

### Scenario: Setting up a Next.js project with AI tools

**Anthropic Marketplace Approach:**
```bash
# 1. Install MCP servers manually
Edit claude_desktop_config.json:
- Add filesystem server
- Add GitHub server
- Restart Claude

# 2. For Cursor rules
Go to GitHub ‚Üí awesome-cursorrules
Copy Next.js rule
Create .cursor/rules/nextjs.md
Paste content

# 3. For Continue prompts
Go to continue-dev/prompt-examples
Download code-review.prompt
Copy to .continue/prompts/

# 4. For testing tools
Search for testing rules on GitHub
Copy each one manually

# Total time: 30+ minutes
# Total sources: 4+ different places
# Versioning: None
# Team sync: Manual sharing
```

**PRPM Approach:**
```bash
prpm install @collection/nextjs-pro

# Done! You now have:
# ‚úÖ MCP filesystem + GitHub servers (auto-configured)
# ‚úÖ Next.js Cursor rules
# ‚úÖ React best practices
# ‚úÖ TypeScript strict mode
# ‚úÖ Tailwind helpers
# ‚úÖ Testing automation
# ‚úÖ Code review prompts
# ‚úÖ All versioned in prpm-lock.json

# Total time: 10 seconds
# Total sources: 1 command
# Versioning: Automatic
# Team sync: git commit prpm-lock.json
```

## The Bottom Line

**Anthropic Marketplace**: Great for discovering MCP servers if you only use Claude Desktop.

**PRPM**: The npm/pip/cargo of AI prompts. Works everywhere, packages everything, powers teams.

### Think of it this way:

| Anthropic Marketplace | PRPM |
|----------------------|------|
| VS Code Extensions Marketplace | npm registry |
| Manual GUI installation | `npm install` |
| One editor only | Universal package manager |
| MCP servers only | Everything AI-related |
| No versioning | Full semver support |
| No bundles | Collections |

**PRPM doesn't replace Anthropic Marketplace.**
**PRPM makes it better by adding package management, multi-editor support, and 10x more content.**
