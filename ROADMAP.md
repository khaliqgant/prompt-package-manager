# prmp Roadmap

This document outlines the future development plans for the Prompt Package Manager (prmp), evolving it from a simple CLI tool into a comprehensive package management ecosystem similar to npm.

## Current State (v0.1.x)

prmp currently provides basic functionality for managing prompt-based files:

- ✅ **CLI Commands**: `add`, `list`, `remove`, `index`
- ✅ **GitHub Integration**: Direct file downloads from raw GitHub URLs
- ✅ **Multi-Platform Support**: macOS, Linux, Windows binaries
- ✅ **Package Types**: Cursor rules and Claude sub-agents
- ✅ **Telemetry**: Usage analytics with PostHog integration

## Phase 1: Enhanced CLI (v0.2.x - v0.3.x)

### Improved Package Management
- **Search functionality**: Find packages by name, description, or tags
- **Package metadata**: Rich descriptions, authors, categories
- **Version management**: Support for semantic versioning and updates
- **Better UX**: Interactive mode, configuration management, backup/restore

### Package Validation
- **Syntax checking**: Validate prompt files before installation
- **Quality scoring**: Basic quality metrics for packages
- **Compatibility checks**: Ensure packages work with target applications

## Phase 2: Registry System (v0.4.x - v0.5.x)

### Central Registry
- **Public registry**: Centralized package repository (similar to npmjs.com)
- **Package publishing**: Tools for authors to publish packages
- **User accounts**: Registration and authentication system
- **Package discovery**: Browse, search, and discover packages

### Publishing Tools
- **Package creation**: Tools to create and validate packages
- **Automated publishing**: CI/CD integration for package releases
- **Package templates**: Starter templates for common prompt types

## Phase 3: Advanced Features (v0.6.x - v0.7.x)

### Package Ecosystem
- **Package categories**: Organized by use case (coding, writing, analysis, etc.)
- **Package collections**: Curated sets of related packages
- **Community features**: Forums, discussions, and collaboration

### Enterprise Features
- **Private registries**: Self-hosted package repositories
- **Team management**: Organization accounts and permissions
- **Audit trails**: Package usage and security tracking

## Phase 4: AI-Powered Features (v0.8.x+)

### Intelligent Package Management
- **Smart recommendations**: AI-powered package suggestions based on usage
- **Auto-updates**: Intelligent package update recommendations
- **Conflict resolution**: AI-assisted dependency conflict resolution

### Advanced Analytics
- **Usage insights**: Detailed analytics on package usage patterns
- **Effectiveness metrics**: Measure prompt effectiveness and success rates
- **Trend analysis**: Identify popular patterns and emerging trends

## Technical Architecture Evolution

### Current Architecture
```
CLI Tool → GitHub Raw URLs → Local File System
```

### Future Architecture
```
CLI Tool → Registry API → Package Database → CDN → Local Cache
```

## Success Metrics

- **User Adoption**: Monthly active users and growth
- **Package Quality**: Average quality scores and improvements
- **Ecosystem Growth**: Number of packages and contributors
- **User Satisfaction**: Feedback scores and retention rates
