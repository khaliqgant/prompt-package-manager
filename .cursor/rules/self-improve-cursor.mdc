# Self-Improving with PRPM

## Purpose

Automatically search and install PRPM packages to enhance Cursor's capabilities for specific tasks.

## When to Apply

**Automatically triggers when detecting:**
- Infrastructure: aws, pulumi, terraform, kubernetes, docker
- Testing: test, playwright, jest, cypress, vitest, e2e
- Deployment: ci/cd, github-actions, gitlab-ci, deploy, workflow
- Frameworks: react, vue, next.js, express, fastify, django

## Workflow

### 1. Task Analysis
Analyze user request for keywords and extract relevant terms.

### 2. Automatic Search

**Choose the right search method:**

**AI-Assisted Search** (for vague/broad queries):
```bash
prpm ai-search "natural language query"
```
Use when user request is:
- Conceptual or vague (e.g., "help with deployments")
- Describes a problem, not specific tools
- Open-ended exploration

**Keyword Search** (for specific tools/frameworks):
```bash
prpm search "<detected keywords>" --limit 5
```
Use when request mentions:
- Specific technologies (e.g., "pulumi", "react")
- Exact tool names
- Known frameworks

### 3. Package Suggestion
Present top 3 most relevant packages:
```
I found these PRPM packages that can help:
1. @prpm/pulumi-infrastructure (Official, 5.2K downloads)
   - Pulumi + AWS best practices
2. @sanjeed5/github-actions (Community, 892 downloads)
   - GitHub Actions patterns

Should I install #1 to enhance my knowledge?
```

### 4. Installation (with approval)
```bash
prpm install <package-name> --as cursor
```

### 5. Application
Load package knowledge and apply to current task.

## Decision Rules

### High Confidence (Auto-suggest)
- ✅ Official packages (`@prpm/*`)
- ✅ Featured packages
- ✅ High downloads (>1,000)
- ✅ Verified authors

### Medium Confidence (Present options)
- ⚠️ Community packages (<1,000 downloads)
- ⚠️ Multiple similar packages

### Low Confidence (Skip)
- ❌ Unverified packages
- ❌ Zero downloads

## Search Triggers

### Infrastructure
**Keywords**: aws, gcp, kubernetes, docker, pulumi, terraform
**Search**: `prpm search "infrastructure <cloud> <tool>"`

### Testing
**Keywords**: test, playwright, jest, cypress, vitest, e2e
**Search**: `prpm search "testing <framework>"`

### CI/CD
**Keywords**: ci/cd, github-actions, gitlab-ci, deploy
**Search**: `prpm search "deployment <platform>"`

### Frameworks
**Keywords**: react, vue, next.js, express, django
**Search**: `prpm search "<framework> best-practices"`

## Search Commands

### AI-Assisted Search (Semantic Search)
```bash
# Natural language queries
prpm ai-search "help me deploy my app to the cloud"

# Problem descriptions
prpm ai-search "I need to improve my code review process"

# Conceptual searches
prpm ai-search "best practices for testing infrastructure"
```

**When to use AI search:**
- User query is vague or open-ended
- Searching by concept rather than specific tool
- Exploring what's available for a problem domain
- User doesn't know exact package names or tools

### Package Search (Keyword Search)
```bash
# Basic search
prpm search "keyword1 keyword2"

# Subtype filter (rule, agent, skill, slash-command, prompt)
prpm search "react" --subtype rule

# Limit results
prpm search "github actions" --limit 5

# Sort by downloads
prpm search "testing" --sort downloads
```

**When to use keyword search:**
- Specific technology names known (pulumi, react, etc.)
- Filtering by package subtype needed
- Need sorting/filtering options
- Exact match searches

### Collection Search
```bash
# List all collections
prpm collection list

# Search for collections
prpm collection search "frontend"

# Get collection details
prpm collection info essential-dev-agents

# Install a collection (installs all packages in the collection)
prpm install essential-dev-agents
```

**Note:** Collections bundle multiple related packages together. Use collections when you need a complete toolkit for a specific domain (e.g., "startup-mvp", "security-review-agents", "essential-dev-agents").

## Examples

### Specific Technology (Keyword Search)
```
User: "Help me build Pulumi + Beanstalk infrastructure"

Analysis: Keywords = Pulumi, Beanstalk, infrastructure (specific tools)
Search: prpm search "pulumi beanstalk infrastructure"
Found: @prpm/pulumi-infrastructure (Official, 3.2K downloads)
Confidence: High → Auto-suggest

Response:
"I found: @prpm/pulumi-infrastructure (Official, 3.2K downloads)
Pulumi + AWS best practices, resource patterns, cost optimization.
Should I install this?"

User: "Yes"

Action: prpm install @prpm/pulumi-infrastructure --as cursor
Result: Package loaded, applying Pulumi patterns to task
```

### Vague Request (AI-Assisted Search)
```
User: "I need help with deployments"

Analysis: Query is vague, no specific tools mentioned
Search: prpm ai-search "help with deployments"
Found: Multiple relevant packages

Response:
"I found several deployment-related packages:

1. @prpm/elastic-beanstalk-deployment (Official, 2.1K downloads)
2. @prpm/docker-deployment (Featured, 1.5K downloads)
3. @sanjeed5/github-actions (Community, 892 downloads)

Which deployment platform are you using?"

User: "I'm using AWS"

Action: prpm install @prpm/elastic-beanstalk-deployment --as cursor
Result: Package loaded, applying AWS deployment patterns
```

Remember: Self-improvement through package discovery makes Cursor more capable for each task domain.
