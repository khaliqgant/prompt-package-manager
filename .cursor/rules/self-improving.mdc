# Self-Improving with PRPM

## Purpose

Automatically search and install PRPM packages to enhance Cursor's capabilities for specific tasks.

## When to Apply

**Automatically triggers when detecting:**
- Infrastructure: aws, pulumi, terraform, kubernetes, docker
- Testing: test, playwright, jest, cypress, vitest, e2e
- Deployment: ci/cd, github-actions, gitlab-ci, deploy, workflow
- Frameworks: react, vue, next.js, express, fastify, django

## Workflow

### 1. Task Analysis
Analyze user request for keywords and extract relevant terms.

### 2. Automatic Search
```bash
prpm search "<detected keywords>" --limit 5
```

### 3. Package Suggestion
Present top 3 most relevant packages:
```
I found these PRPM packages that can help:
1. @prpm/pulumi-infrastructure (Official, 5.2K downloads)
   - Pulumi + AWS best practices
2. @sanjeed5/github-actions (Community, 892 downloads)
   - GitHub Actions patterns

Should I install #1 to enhance my knowledge?
```

### 4. Installation (with approval)
```bash
prpm install <package-name> --as cursor
```

### 5. Application
Load package knowledge and apply to current task.

## Decision Rules

### High Confidence (Auto-suggest)
- ✅ Official packages (`@prpm/*`)
- ✅ Featured packages
- ✅ High downloads (>1,000)
- ✅ Verified authors

### Medium Confidence (Present options)
- ⚠️ Community packages (<1,000 downloads)
- ⚠️ Multiple similar packages

### Low Confidence (Skip)
- ❌ Unverified packages
- ❌ Zero downloads

## Search Triggers

### Infrastructure
**Keywords**: aws, gcp, kubernetes, docker, pulumi, terraform
**Search**: `prpm search "infrastructure <cloud> <tool>"`

### Testing
**Keywords**: test, playwright, jest, cypress, vitest, e2e
**Search**: `prpm search "testing <framework>"`

### CI/CD
**Keywords**: ci/cd, github-actions, gitlab-ci, deploy
**Search**: `prpm search "deployment <platform>"`

### Frameworks
**Keywords**: react, vue, next.js, express, django
**Search**: `prpm search "<framework> best-practices"`

## Example

```
User: "Help me build Pulumi + Beanstalk infrastructure"

Analysis: Keywords = Pulumi, Beanstalk, infrastructure
Search: prpm search "pulumi beanstalk infrastructure"
Found: @prpm/pulumi-infrastructure (Official, 3.2K downloads)
Confidence: High → Auto-suggest

Response:
"I found: @prpm/pulumi-infrastructure (Official, 3.2K downloads)
Pulumi + AWS best practices, resource patterns, cost optimization.
Should I install this?"

User: "Yes"

Action: prpm install @prpm/pulumi-infrastructure --as cursor
Result: Package loaded, applying Pulumi patterns to task
```

Remember: Self-improvement through package discovery makes Cursor more capable for each task domain.
